Finally, it is the de-\\nfacto choice of ensemble method and is used in challenges\\nsuch as the Netﬂix prize [3].\\nIn this paper, we describe XGBoost, a scalable machine\\nlearning system for tree boosting. The system is available as\\nan open source package2. The impact of the system has been\\nwidely recognized in a number of machine learning and data\\nmining challenges. Take the challenges hosted by the ma-\\nchine learning competition site Kaggle for example. Among\\nthe 29 challenge winning solutions 3 published at Kaggle’s\\nblog during 2015, 17 solutions used XGBoost. Among these\\nsolutions, eight solely used XGBoost to train the model,\\nwhile most others combined XGBoost with neural nets in en-\\nsembles. For comparison, the second most popular method,\\ndeep neural nets, was used in 11 solutions. The success\\nof the system was also witnessed in KDDCup 2015, where\\nXGBoost was used by every winning team in the top-10.\\nMoreover, the winning teams reported that ensemble meth-\\nods outperform a well-conﬁgured XGBoost by only a small\\namount [1].\\nThese results demonstrate that our system gives state-of-\\nthe-art results on a wide range of problems. Examples of\\nthe problems in these winning solutions include: store sales\\nprediction; high energy physics event classiﬁcation; web text\\nclassiﬁcation; customer behavior prediction; motion detec-\\ntion; ad click through rate prediction; malware classiﬁcation;\\nproduct categorization; hazard risk prediction; massive on-\\nline course dropout rate prediction.

Besides these major contributions, we also\\nmake additional improvements in proposing a regularized\\nlearning objective, which we will include for completeness.\\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We\\nwill ﬁrst review tree boosting and introduce a regularized\\nobjective in Sec. 2. We then describe the split ﬁnding meth-\\nods in Sec. 3 as well as the system design in Sec. 4, including\\nexperimental results when relevant to provide quantitative\\nsupport for each optimization we describe. Related work\\nis discussed in Sec. 5. Detailed end-to-end evaluations are\\nincluded in Sec. 6. Finally we conclude the paper in Sec. 7.\\n2. TREE BOOSTING IN A NUTSHELL\\nWe review gradient tree boosting algorithms in this sec-\\ntion. The derivation follows from the same idea in existing\\nliteratures in gradient boosting. Specicially the second order\\nmethod is originated from Friedman et al. [12]. We make mi-\\nnor improvements in the reguralized objective, which were\\nfound helpful in practice.\\n2.1 Regularized Learning Objective\\nFor a given data set with n examples and m features\\nD= {(xi,yi)}(|D|= n,xi ∈Rm,yi ∈R), a tree ensem-\\nble model (shown in Fig. 1) uses K additive functions to\\npredict the output.\\nˆyi = φ(xi) =\\nK∑\\nk=1\\nfk(xi), fk ∈F, (1)\\nwhere F = {f(x) = wq(x)}(q : Rm →T,w ∈RT) is the\\nspace of regression trees (also known as CART). Here q rep-\\nresents the structure of each tree that maps an example to\\nthe corresponding leaf index. T is the number of leaves in the\\ntree. Each fk corresponds to an independent tree structure\\nq and leaf weights w. Unlike decision trees, each regression\\ntree contains a continuous score on each of the leaf, we use\\nwi to represent score on i-th leaf. For a given example, we\\nwill use the decision rules in the trees (given byq) to classify\\nFigure 1: Tree Ensemble Model. The ﬁnal predic-\\ntion for a given example is the sum of predictions\\nfrom each tree.\\nit into the leaves and calculate the ﬁnal prediction by sum-\\nming up the score in the corresponding leaves (given by w).\\nTo learn the set of functions used in the model, we minimize\\nthe following regularized objective.\\nL(φ) =\\n∑\\ni\\nl(ˆyi,yi) +\\n∑\\nk\\nΩ(fk)\\nwhere Ω(f) = γT + 1\\n2λ∥w∥2\\n(2)\\nHere l is a diﬀerentiable convex loss function that measures\\nthe diﬀerence between the prediction ˆyi and the target yi.\\nThe second term Ω penalizes the complexity of the model\\n(i.e., the regression tree functions). The additional regular-\\nization term helps to smooth the ﬁnal learnt weights to avoid\\nover-ﬁtting. Intuitively, the regularized objective will tend\\nto select a model employing simple and predictive functions.\\nA similar regularization technique has been used in Regu-\\nlarized greedy forest (RGF) [25] model. Our objective and\\nthe corresponding learning algorithm is simpler than RGF\\nand easier to parallelize. When the regularization parame-\\nter is set to zero, the objective falls back to the traditional\\ngradient tree boosting.\\n2.2 Gradient Tree Boosting\\nThe tree ensemble model in Eq. (2) includes functions as\\nparameters and cannot be optimized using traditional opti-\\nmization methods in Euclidean space. Instead, the model\\nis trained in an additive manner. Formally, let ˆ y(t)\\ni be the\\nprediction of the i-th instance at the t-th iteration, we will\\nneed to add ft to minimize the following objective.\\nL(t) =\\nn∑\\ni=1\\nl(yi, ˆyi\\n(t−1) + ft(xi)) + Ω(ft)\\nThis means we greedily add the ft that most improves our\\nmodel according to Eq. (2). Second-order approximation\\ncan be used to quickly optimize the objective in the general\\nsetting [12].\\nL(t) ≃\\nn∑\\ni=1\\n[l(yi,ˆy(t−1)) + gift(xi) + 1\\n2hif2\\nt(xi)] + Ω(ft)\\nwhere gi = ∂ˆy(t−1) l(yi,ˆy(t−1)) and hi = ∂2\\nˆy(t−1) l(yi,ˆy(t−1))\\nare ﬁrst and second order gradient statistics on the loss func-\\ntion. We can remove the constant terms to obtain the fol-\\nlowing simpliﬁed objective at step t.\\n˜L(t) =\\nn∑\\ni=1\\n[gift(xi) + 1\\n2hif2\\nt(xi)] + Ω(ft) (3)'),\n",

Fig. 2 illustrates\\nhow this score can be calculated.\\nNormally it is impossible to enumerate all the possible\\ntree structures q.

The ﬁrst technique is shrinkage introduced by Fried-\\nman [11]. Shrinkage scales newly added weights by a factor\\nη after each step of tree boosting. Similar to a learning rate\\nin tochastic optimization, shrinkage reduces the inﬂuence of\\neach individual tree and leaves space for future trees to im-\\nprove the model. The second technique is column (feature)\\nsubsampling.

According to user feedback, using col-\\numn sub-sampling prevents over-ﬁtting even more so than\\nthe traditional row sub-sampling (which is also supported).\\nThe usage of column sub-samples also speeds up computa-\\ntions of the parallel algorithm described later.\\n3. SPLIT FINDING ALGORITHMS\\n3.1 Basic Exact Greedy Algorithm\\nOne of the key problems in tree learning is to ﬁnd the\\nbest split as indicated by Eq (7). In order to do so, a split\\nﬁnding algorithm enumerates over all the possible splits on\\nall the features. We call this the exact greedy algorithm.\\nMost existing single machine tree boosting implementations,\\nsuch as scikit-learn [20], R’s gbm [21] as well as the single\\nmachine version of XGBoost support the exact greedy algo-\\nrithm. The exact greedy algorithm is shown in Alg. 1. It\\nis computationally demanding to enumerate all the possible\\nsplits for continuous features. In order to do so eﬃciently,\\nthe algorithm must ﬁrst sort the data according to feature\\nvalues and visit the data in sorted order to accumulate the\\ngradient statistics for the structure score in Eq (7).\\n3.2 Approximate Algorithm\\nThe exact greedy algorithm is very powerful since it enu-\\nmerates over all possible splitting points greedily. However,\\nit is impossible to eﬃciently do so when the data does not ﬁt\\nentirely into memory. Same problem also arises in the dis-\\n4https://www.salford-systems.com/products/treenet'),\n",

To support eﬀective gradient tree boosting\\nin these two settings, an approximate algorithm is needed.\\nWe summarize an approximate framework, which resem-\\nbles the ideas proposed in past literatures [17, 2, 22], in\\nAlg. 2. To summarize, the algorithm ﬁrst proposes can-\\ndidate splitting points according to percentiles of feature\\ndistribution (a speciﬁc criteria will be given in Sec. 3.3).\\nThe algorithm then maps the continuous features into buck-\\nets split by these candidate points, aggregates the statistics\\nand ﬁnds the best solution among proposals based on the\\naggregated statistics.\\nThere are two variants of the algorithm, depending on\\nwhen the proposal is given. The global variant proposes all\\nthe candidate splits during the initial phase of tree construc-\\ntion, and uses the same proposals for split ﬁnding at all lev-\\nels. The local variant re-proposes after each split. The global\\nmethod requires less proposal steps than the local method.\\nHowever, usually more candidate points are needed for the\\nglobal proposal because candidates are not reﬁned after each\\nsplit. The local proposal reﬁnes the candidates after splits,\\nand can potentially be more appropriate for deeper trees. A\\ncomparison of diﬀerent algorithms on a Higgs boson dataset\\nis given by Fig. 3. We ﬁnd that the local proposal indeed\\nrequires fewer candidates. The global proposal can be as\\naccurate as the local one given enough candidates.\\nMost existing approximate algorithms for distributed tree\\nlearning also follow this framework. Notably, it is also possi-\\nble to directly construct approximate histograms of gradient\\nstatistics [22]. It is also possible to use other variants of bin-\\nning strategies instead of quantile [17]. Quantile strategy\\nbeneﬁt from being distributable and recomputable, which\\nwe will detail in next subsection. From Fig. 3, we also ﬁnd\\nthat the quantile strategy can get the same accuracy as exact\\ngreedy given reasonable approximation level.\\nOur system eﬃciently supports exact greedy for the single\\nmachine setting, as well as approximate algorithm with both\\nlocal and global proposal methods for all settings. Users can\\nfreely choose between the methods according to their needs.\\n3.3 Weighted Quantile Sketch\\nOne important step in the approximate algorithm is to\\npropose candidate split points. Usually percentiles of a fea-\\nFigure 4: Tree structure with default directions. An\\nexample will be classiﬁed into the default direction\\nwhen the feature needed for the split is missing.\\nture are used to make candidates distribute evenly on the\\ndata. Formally, let multi-setDk = {(x1k,h1),(x2k,h2) ···(xnk,hn)}\\nrepresent the k-th feature values and second order gradient\\nstatistics of each training instances. We can deﬁne a rank\\nfunctions rk : R →[0,+∞) as\\nrk(z) = 1∑\\n(x,h)∈Dk\\nh\\n∑\\n(x,h)∈Dk,x<z\\nh, (8)\\nwhich represents the proportion of instances whose feature\\nvalue k is smaller than z. The goal is to ﬁnd candidate split\\npoints {sk1,sk2,···skl}, such that\\n|rk(sk,j) −rk(sk,j+1)|<ϵ, s k1 = min\\ni\\nxik,skl = max\\ni\\nxik.\\n(9)\\nHere ϵ is an approximation factor. Intuitively, this means\\nthat there is roughly 1 /ϵ candidate points. Here each data\\npoint is weighted byhi. To see why hi represents the weight,\\nwe can rewrite Eq (3) as\\nn∑\\ni=1\\n1\\n2hi(ft(xi) −gi/hi)2 + Ω(ft) + constant,\\nwhich is exactly weighted squared loss with labels gi/hi\\nand weights hi. For large datasets, it is non-trivial to ﬁnd\\ncandidate splits that satisfy the criteria. When every in-\\nstance has equal weights, an existing algorithm called quan-\\ntile sketch [14, 24] solves the problem. However, there is no\\nexisting quantile sketch for the weighted datasets. There-\\nfore, most existing approximate algorithms either resorted\\nto sorting on a random subset of data which have a chance of\\nfailure or heuristics that do not have theoretical guarantee.\\nTo solve this problem, we introduced a novel distributed\\nweighted quantile sketch algorithm that can handle weighted\\ndata with a provable theoretical guarantee. The general idea\\nis to propose a data structure that supportsmerge and prune\\noperations, with each operation proven to maintain a certain\\naccuracy level. A detailed description of the algorithm as\\nwell as proofs are given in the appendix.\\n3.4 Sparsity-aware Split Finding\\nIn many real-world problems, it is quite common for the\\ninput x to be sparse. There are multiple possible causes\\nfor sparsity: 1) presence of missing values in the data; 2)\\nfrequent zero entries in the statistics; and, 3) artifacts of\\nfeature engineering such as one-hot encoding.

SYSTEM DESIGN\\n4.1 Column Block for Parallel Learning\\nThe most time consuming part of tree learning is to get\\nthe data into sorted order. In order to reduce the cost of\\nsorting, we propose to store the data in in-memory units,\\nwhich we called block. Data in each block is stored in the\\ncompressed column (CSC) format, with each column sorted\\nby the corresponding feature value. This input data layout\\nonly needs to be computed once before training, and can be\\nreused in later iterations.\\nIn the exact greedy algorithm, we store the entire dataset\\nin a single block and run the split search algorithm by lin-\\nearly scanning over the pre-sorted entries. We do the split\\nﬁnding of all leaves collectively, so one scan over the block\\nwill collect the statistics of the split candidates in all leaf\\nbranches. Fig. 6 shows how we transform a dataset into the\\nformat and ﬁnd the optimal split using the block structure.\\nThe block structure also helps when using the approxi-\\nmate algorithms. Multiple blocks can be used in this case,\\nwith each block corresponding to subset of rows in the dataset.\\nDiﬀerent blocks can be distributed across machines, or stored\\non disk in the out-of-core setting. Using the sorted struc-\\nture, the quantile ﬁnding step becomes a linear scan over\\nthe sorted columns. This is especially valuable for local pro-\\nposal algorithms, where candidates are generated frequently\\nat each branch. The binary search in histogram aggregation\\nalso becomes a linear time merge style algorithm.\\nCollecting statistics for each column can be parallelized,\\ngiving us a parallel algorithm for split ﬁnding. Importantly,\\nthe column block structure also supports column subsam-\\npling, as it is easy to select a subset of columns in a block.'),\n",

Here O(∥x∥0 log n) is the one\\ntime preprocessing cost that can be amortized. This analysis\\nshows that the block structure helps to save an additional\\nlog n factor, which is signiﬁcant when n is large. For the\\napproximate algorithm, the time complexity of original al-\\ngorithm with binary search is O(Kd∥x∥0 log q). Here q is\\nthe number of proposal candidates in the dataset. While q\\nis usually between 32 and 100, the log factor still introduces\\noverhead. Using the block structure, we can reduce the time\\nto O(Kd∥x∥0 + ∥x∥0 log B), where B is the maximum num-\\nber of rows in each block. Again we can save the additional\\nlog q factor in computation.\\n4.2 Cache-aware Access\\nWhile the proposed block structure helps optimize the\\ncomputation complexity of split ﬁnding, the new algorithm\\nrequires indirect fetches of gradient statistics by row index,\\nsince these values are accessed in order of feature.

Speciﬁcally,\\nwe allocate an internal buﬀer in each thread, fetch the gra-\\ndient statistics into it, and then perform accumulation in\\na mini-batch manner. This prefetching changes the direct\\nread/write dependency to a longer dependency and helps to\\nreduce the runtime overhead when number of rows in the\\nis large.

Besides processors and\\nmemory, it is important to utilize disk space to handle data\\nthat does not ﬁt into main memory. To enable out-of-core\\ncomputation, we divide the data into multiple blocks and\\nstore each block on disk. During computation, it is impor-\\ntant to use an independent thread to pre-fetch the block into\\na main memory buﬀer, so computation can happen in con-\\ncurrence with disk reading. However, this does not entirely\\nsolve the problem since the disk reading takes most of the\\ncomputation time. It is important to reduce the overhead\\nand increase the throughput of disk IO. We mainly use two\\ntechniques to improve the out-of-core computation.\\nBlock Compression The ﬁrst technique we use is block\\ncompression. The block is compressed by columns, and de-\\ncompressed on the ﬂy by an independent thread when load-\\ning into main memory. This helps to trade some of the\\ncomputation in decompression with the disk reading cost.\\nWe use a general purpose compression algorithm for com-\\npressing the features values. For the row index, we substract\\nthe row index by the begining index of the block and use a\\n16bit integer to store each oﬀset. This requires 216 examples\\nper block, which is conﬁrmed to be a good setting. In most\\nof the dataset we tested, we achieve roughly a 26% to 29%\\ncompression ratio.\\nBlock Sharding The second technique is to shard the data\\nonto multiple disks in an alternative manner. A pre-fetcher\\nthread is assigned to each disk and fetches the data into an\\nin-memory buﬀer. The training thread then alternatively\\nreads the data from each buﬀer. This helps to increase the\\nthroughput of disk reading when multiple disks are available.\\n5. RELATED WORKS\\nOur system implements gradient boosting [10], which per-\\nforms additive optimization in functional space. Gradient\\ntree boosting has been successfully used in classiﬁcation [12],\\nlearning to rank [5], structured prediction [8] as well as other\\nﬁelds. XGBoost incorporates a regularized model to prevent\\noverﬁtting. This this resembles previous work on regularized\\ngreedy forest [25], but simpliﬁes the objective and algorithm\\nfor parallelization. Column sampling is a simple but eﬀective\\ntechnique borrowed from RandomForest [4]. While sparsity-\\naware learning is essential in other types of models such as\\nlinear models [9], few works on tree learning have considered\\nthis topic in a principled way. The algorithm proposed in\\nthis paper is the ﬁrst uniﬁed approach to handle all kinds of\\nsparsity patterns.\\nThere are several existing works on parallelizing tree learn-\\ning [22, 19]. Most of these algorithms fall into the ap-\\nproximate framework described in this paper. Notably, it\\nis also possible to partition data by columns [23] and ap-\\nply the exact greedy algorithm. This is also supported in\\nour framework, and the techniques such as cache-aware pre-\\nfecthing can be used to beneﬁt this type of algorithm. While\\nmost existing works focus on the algorithmic aspect of par-\\nallelization, our work improves in two unexplored system di-\\nrections: out-of-core computation and cache-aware learning.\\nThis gives us insights on how the system and the algorithm\\ncan be jointly optimized and provides an end-to-end system\\nthat can handle large scale problems with very limited com-\\nputing resources. We also summarize the comparison be-\\ntween our system and existing opensource implementations\\nin Table 1.\\nQuantile summary (without weights) is a classical prob-\\nlem in the database community [14, 24]. However, the ap-\\nproximate tree boosting algorithm reveals a more general\\nproblem – ﬁnding quantiles on weighted data. To the best\\nof our knowledge, the weighted quantile sketch proposed in\\nthis paper is the ﬁrst method to solve this problem. The\\nweighted quantile summary is also not speciﬁc to the tree\\nlearning and can beneﬁt other applications in data science\\nand machine learning in the future.\\n6. END TO END EV ALUATIONS\\n6.1 System Implementation\\nWe implemented XGBoost as an open source package 5.\\nThe package is portable and reusable. It supports various\\nweighted classiﬁcation and rank objective functions, as well\\nas user deﬁned objective function. It is available in popular\\nlanguages such as python, R, Julia and integrates naturally\\nwith language native data science pipelines such as scikit-\\nlearn. The distributed version is built on top of the rabit\\nlibrary6 for allreduce. The portability of XGBoost makes it\\navailable in many ecosystems, instead of only being tied to\\na speciﬁc platform. The distributed XGBoost runs natively\\non Hadoop, MPI Sun Grid engine. Recently, we also enable\\ndistributed XGBoost on jvm bigdata stacks such as Flink\\nand Spark. The distributed version has also been integrated\\ninto cloud platform Tianchi 7 of Alibaba. We believe that\\nthere will be more integrations in the future.\\n6.2 Dataset and Setup\\n5https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost\\n6https://github.com/dmlc/rabit\\n7https://tianchi.aliyun.com'),\n",

CONCLUSION\\nIn this paper, we described the lessons we learnt when\\nbuilding XGBoost, a scalable tree boosting system that is\\nwidely used by data scientists and provides state-of-the-art\\nresults on many problems. We proposed a novel sparsity\\naware algorithm for handling sparse data and a theoretically\\njustiﬁed weighted quantile sketch for approximate learning.\\nOur experience shows that cache access patterns, data com-\\npression and sharding are essential elements for building a\\nscalable end-to-end system for tree boosting. These lessons\\ncan be applied to other machine learning systems as well.\\nBy combining these insights, XGBoost is able to solve real-\\nworld scale problems using a minimal amount of resources.\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe would like to thank Tyler B.

WEIGHTED QUANTILE SKETCH\\nIn this section, we introduce the weighted quantile sketch algo-\\nrithm. Approximate answer of quantile queries is for many real-\\nworld applications. One classical approach to this problem is GK\\nalgorithm [14] and extensions based on the GK framework [24].\\nThe main component of these algorithms is a data structure called\\nquantile summary, that is able to answer quantile queries with\\nrelative accuracy of ϵ. Two operations are deﬁned for a quantile\\nsummary:\\n• A merge operation that combines two summaries with ap-\\nproximation error ϵ1 and ϵ2 together and create a merged\\nsummary with approximation error max( ϵ1,ϵ2).\\n• A prune operation that reduces the number of elements in\\nthe summary to b+1 and changes approximation error from\\nϵ to ϵ+ 1\\nb.\\nA quantile summary with merge and prune operations forms basic\\nbuilding blocks of the distributed and streaming quantile comput-\\ning algorithms [24].\\nIn order to use quantile computation for approximate tree boost-\\ning, we need to ﬁnd quantiles on weighted data. This more gen-\\neral problem is not supported by any of the existing algorithm. In\\nthis section, we describe a non-trivial weighted quantile summary\\nstructure to solve this problem. Importantly, the new algorithm\\ncontains merge and prune operations with the same guarantee as\\nGK summary. This allows our summary to be plugged into all\\nthe frameworks used GK summary as building block and answer\\nquantile queries over weighted data eﬃciently.\\nA.1 Formalization and Deﬁnitions\\nGiven an input multi-set D= {(x1,w1),(x2,w2) ··· (xn,wn)}\\nsuch that wi ∈[0,+∞),xi ∈X . Each xi corresponds to a po-\\nsition of the point and wi is the weight of the point. Assume\\nwe have a total order < deﬁned on X. Let us deﬁne two rank\\nfunctions r−\\nD,r+\\nD: X→ [0,+∞)\\nr−\\nD(y) =\\n∑\\n(x,w)∈D,x<y\\nw (10)\\nr+\\nD(y) =\\n∑\\n(x,w)∈D,x≤y\\nw (11)\\nWe should note that since Dis deﬁned to be a multiset of the\\npoints. It can contain multiple record with exactly same position\\nx and weight w. We also deﬁne another weight function ωD :\\nX→ [0,+∞) as\\nωD(y) = r+\\nD(y) −r−\\nD(y) =\\n∑\\n(x,w)∈D,x=y\\nw. (12)\\nFinally, we also deﬁne the weight of multi-set Dto be the sum of\\nweights of all the points in the set\\nω(D) =\\n∑\\n(x,w)∈D\\nw (13)\\nOur task is given a series of input D, to estimate r+(y) and r−(y)\\nfor y∈X as well as ﬁnding points with speciﬁc rank. Given these\\nnotations, we deﬁne quantile summary of weighted examples as\\nfollows:\\nDefinition A.1. Quantile Summary of Weighted Data\\nA quantile summary for Dis deﬁned to be tuple Q(D) = (S,˜r+\\nD,˜r−\\nD,˜ωD),\\nwhere S = {x1,x2,··· ,xk}is selected from the points in D(i.e.\\nxi ∈{x|(x,w) ∈D}) with the following properties:\\n1) xi <xi+1 for all i, and x1 and xk are minimum and max-\\nimum point in D:\\nx1 = min\\n(x,w)∈D\\nx, xk = max\\n(x,w)∈D\\nx\\n2) ˜r+\\nD, ˜r−\\nD and ˜ωD are functions in S →[0,+∞), that satisﬁes\\n˜r−\\nD(xi) ≤r−\\nD(xi), ˜r+\\nD(xi) ≥r+\\nD(xi), ˜ωD(xi) ≤ωD(xi), (14)\\nthe equality sign holds for maximum and minimum point ( ˜r−\\nD(xi) =\\nr−\\nD(xi), ˜r+\\nD(xi) = r+\\nD(xi) and ˜ωD(xi) = ωD(xi) for i∈{1,k}).\\nFinally, the function value must also satisfy the following con-\\nstraints\\n˜r−\\nD(xi) + ˜ωD(xi) ≤˜r−\\nD(xi+1), ˜r+\\nD(xi) ≤˜r+\\nD(xi+1) −˜ωD(xi+1)\\n(15)\\nSince these functions are only deﬁned onS, it is suﬃce to use 4k\\nrecord to store the summary. Speciﬁcally, we need to remember\\neach xi and the corresponding function values of each xi.\\nDefinition A.2. Extension of Function Domains\\nGiven a quantile summary Q(D) = ( S,˜r+\\nD,˜r−\\nD,˜ωD) deﬁned in\\nDeﬁnition A.1, the domain of ˜r+\\nD, ˜r−\\nD and ˜ωD were deﬁned only\\nin S. We extend the deﬁnition of these functions to X→ [0,+∞)\\nas follows\\nWhen y <x1:\\n˜r−\\nD(y) = 0, ˜r+\\nD(y) = 0, ˜ωD(y) = 0 (16)\\nWhen y >xk:\\n˜r−\\nD(y) = ˜r+\\nD(xk), ˜r+\\nD(y) = ˜r+\\nD(xk), ˜ωD(y) = 0 (17)\\nWhen y∈(xi,xi+1) for some i:\\n˜r−\\nD(y) = ˜r−\\nD(xi) + ˜ωD(xi),\\n˜r+\\nD(y) = ˜r+\\nD(xi+1) −˜ωD(xi+1),\\n˜ωD(y) = 0\\n(18)\\nLemma A.1. Extended Constraint\\nThe extended deﬁnition of ˜r−\\nD, ˜r+\\nD, ˜ωD satisﬁes the following\\nconstraints\\n˜r−\\nD(y) ≤r−\\nD(y), ˜r+\\nD(y) ≥r+\\nD(y), ˜ωD(y) ≤ωD(y) (19)\\n˜r−\\nD(y) + ˜ωD(y) ≤˜r−\\nD(x), ˜r+\\nD(y) ≤˜r+\\nD(x) −˜ωD(x), for all y <x\\n(20)\\nProof. The only non-trivial part is to prove the case when\\ny∈(xi,xi+1):\\n˜r−\\nD(y) = ˜r−\\nD(xi) + ˜ωD(xi) ≤r−\\nD(xi) + ωD(xi) ≤r−\\nD(y)\\n˜r+\\nD(y) = ˜r+\\nD(xi+1) −˜ωD(xi+1) ≥r+\\nD(xi+1) −ωD(xi+1) ≥r+\\nD(y)\\nThis proves Eq. (19). Furthermore, we can verify that\\n˜r+\\nD(xi) ≤˜r+\\nD(xi+1) −˜ωD(xi+1) = ˜r+\\nD(y) −˜ωD(y)\\n˜r−\\nD(y) + ˜ωD(y) = ˜r−\\nD(xi) + ˜ωD(xi) + 0 ≤˜r−\\nD(xi+1)\\n˜r+\\nD(y) = ˜r+\\nD(xi+1) −˜ωD(xi+1)\\nUsing these facts and transitivity of < relation, we can prove\\nEq. (20)\\nWe should note that the extension is based on the ground case\\ndeﬁned in S, and we do not require extra space to store the sum-\\nmary in order to use the extended deﬁnition. We are now ready\\nto introduce the deﬁnition of ϵ-approximate quantile summary.\\nDefinition A.3. ϵ-Approximate Quantile Summary\\nGiven a quantile summary Q(D) = (S,˜r+\\nD,˜r−\\nD,˜ωD), we call it is\\nϵ-approximate summary if for any y∈X\\n˜r+\\nD(y) −˜r−\\nD(y) −˜ωD(y) ≤ϵω(D) (21)\\nWe use this deﬁnition since we know that r−(y) ∈[˜r−\\nD(y),˜r+\\nD(y)−\\n˜ωD(y)] and r+(y) ∈[˜r−\\nD(y) + ˜ωD(y),˜r+\\nD(y)]. Eq. (21) means the\\nwe can get estimation of r+(y) and r−(y) by error of at most\\nϵω(D).'),\n",

This is a very useful property which will be\\nused in the proofs in later sections.\\nA.2 Construction of Initial Summary\\nGiven a small multi-set D= {(x1,w1),(x2,w2),··· ,(xn,wn)},\\nwe can construct initial summaryQ(D) = {S,˜r+\\nD,˜r−\\nD,˜ωD}, with S\\nto the set of all values in D(S = {x|(x,w) ∈D}), and ˜r+\\nD,˜r−\\nD,˜ωD\\ndeﬁned to be\\n˜r+\\nD(x) = r+\\nD(x), ˜r−\\nD(x) = r−\\nD(x), ˜ωD(x) = ωD(x) for x∈S\\n(24)\\nThe constructed summary is 0-approximate summary, since it can\\nanswer all the queries accurately. The constructed summary can\\nbe feed into future operations described in the latter sections.\\nA.3 Merge Operation\\nIn this section, we deﬁne how we can merge the two summaries\\ntogether. Assume we have Q(D1) = ( S1,˜r+\\nD1 ,˜r−\\nD1 ,˜ωD1 ) and\\nQ(D2) = ( S2,˜r+\\nD1 ,˜r−\\nD2 ,˜ωD2 ) quantile summary of two dataset\\nD1 and D2. Let D= D1 ∪D2, and deﬁne the merged summary\\nQ(D) = (S,˜r+\\nD,˜r−\\nD,˜ωD) as follows.\\nS = {x1,x2 ··· ,xk},xi ∈S1 or xi ∈S2 (25)\\nThe points in S are combination of points in S1 and S2. And the\\nfunction ˜r+\\nD,˜r−\\nD,˜ωDare deﬁned to be\\n˜r−\\nD(xi) = ˜r−\\nD1 (xi) + ˜r−\\nD2 (xi) (26)\\n˜r+\\nD(xi) = ˜r+\\nD1 (xi) + ˜r+\\nD2 (xi) (27)\\n˜ωD(xi) = ˜ωD1 (xi) + ˜ωD2 (xi) (28)\\nHere we use functions deﬁned on S →[0,+∞) on the left sides of\\nequalities and use the extended function deﬁnitions on the right\\nsides.\\nDue to additive nature of r+, r−and ω, which can be formally\\nwritten as\\nr−\\nD(y) =r−\\nD1 (y) + r−\\nD2 (y),\\nr+\\nD(y) =r+\\nD1 (y) + r+\\nD2 (y),\\nωD(y) =ωD1 (y) + ωD2 (y),\\n(29)\\nand the extended constraint property in Lemma A.1, we can verify\\nthat Q(D) satisﬁes all the constraints in Deﬁnition A.1. Therefore\\nit is a valid quantile summary.\\nLemma A.3. The combined quantile summary satisﬁes\\n˜r−\\nD(y) = ˜r−\\nD1 (y) + ˜r−\\nD2 (y) (30)\\n˜r+\\nD(y) = ˜r+\\nD1 (y) + ˜r+\\nD2 (y) (31)\\n˜ωD(y) = ˜ωD1 (y) + ˜ωD2 (y) (32)\\nfor all y∈X\\nAlgorithm 4: Query Function g(Q,d)\\nInput: d: 0 ≤d≤ω(D)\\nInput: Q(D) = (S,˜r+\\nD,˜r−\\nD,˜ωD) where\\nS = x1,x2,··· ,xk\\nif d< 1\\n2 [˜r−\\nD(x1) + ˜r+\\nD(x1)] then return x1 ;\\nif d≥1\\n2 [˜r−\\nD(xk) + ˜r+\\nD(xk)] then return xk ;\\nFind i such that\\n1\\n2 [˜r−\\nD(xi) + ˜r+\\nD(xi)] ≤d< 1\\n2 [˜r−\\nD(xi+1) + ˜r+\\nD(xi+1)]\\nif 2d< ˜r−\\nD(xi) + ˜ωD(xi) + ˜r+\\nD(xi+1) −˜ωD(xi+1) then\\nreturn xi\\nelse\\nreturn xi+1\\nend\\nThis can be obtained by straight-forward application of Deﬁni-\\ntion A.2.\\nTheorem A.1. If Q(D1) is ϵ1-approximate summary, and Q(D2)\\nis ϵ2-approximate summary. Then the merged summary Q(D) is\\nmax(ϵ1,ϵ2)-approximate summary.\\nProof. For any y∈X, we have\\n˜r+\\nD(y) −˜r−\\nD(y) −˜ωD(y)\\n=[˜r+\\nD1 (y) + ˜r+\\nD2 (y)] −[˜r−\\nD1 (y) + ˜r−\\nD2 (y)] −[˜ωD1 (y) + ˜ωD2 (y)]\\n≤ϵ1ω(D1) + ϵ2ω(D2) ≤max(ϵ1,ϵ2)ω(D1 ∪D2)\\nHere the ﬁrst inequality is due to Lemma A.3.\\nA.4 Prune Operation\\nBefore we start discussing the prune operation, we ﬁrst in-\\ntroduce a query function g(Q,d). The deﬁnition of function is\\nshown in Algorithm 4. For a given rank d, the function returns\\na x whose rank is close to d. This property is formally described\\nin the following Lemma.\\nLemma A.4. For a given ϵ-approximate summary Q(D) =\\n(S,˜r+\\nD,˜r−\\nD,˜ωD), x∗= g(Q,d) satisﬁes the following property\\nd≥˜r+\\nD(x∗) −˜ωD(x∗) −ϵ\\n2 ω(D)\\nd≤˜r−\\nD(x∗) + ˜ωD(x∗) + ϵ\\n2 ω(D)\\n(33)\\nProof.

W ord Embeddings\\ni. Motivation\\nIt is obvious that every mathematical system\\nor algorithm needs some sort of numeric input\\nto work with. However, while images and\\naudio naturally come in the form of rich, high-\\ndimensional vectors (i.e. pixel intensity for\\nimages and power spectral density coefﬁcients\\nfor audio data), words are treated as discrete\\natomic symbols.\\nThe naive way of converting words to vectors\\nmight assign each word a one-hot vector in\\nℜ|V| where |V| being vocabulary size. This\\nvector will be all zeros except one unique index\\nfor each word. Representing words in this way\\nleads to substantial data sparsity and usually\\nmeans that we may need more data in order to\\nsuccessfully train statistical models.\\nFigure 1: Density of different data sources.\\nWhat mentioned above raise the need for\\ncontinuous, vector space representations of\\nwords that contain data that can be leveraged\\nby models. To be more speciﬁc we want seman-\\ntically similar words to be mapped to nearby\\npoints, thus making the representation carry\\nuseful information about the word actual mean-\\ning.\\nii. Word Embeddings Methods\\nWord embeddings models can be divided into\\nmain categories:\\n•Count-based methods\\n•Predictive methods\\nModels in both categories share, in at least\\nsome way, the assumption that words that ap-\\npear in the same contexts share semantic mean-\\ning.\\nOne of the most inﬂuential early works\\nin count-based methods is the LSI/LSA\\n(Latent Semantic Indexing/Analysis)\\n[Deerwester et al., 1990] method. This\\nmethod is based on the Firth’s hypothesisfrom\\n1957 [Firth, 1957] that the meaning of a word\\nis deﬁned \"by the company it keeps\". This\\nhypothesis leads to a very simple albeit a very\\nhigh-dimensional word embedding. Formally,\\neach word can be represented as a vector in ℜN\\nwhere N is the unique number of words in a\\ngiven dictionary (in practice N=100,000). Then,\\nby taking a very large corpus (e.g. Wikipedia),\\nlet Count 5(w1, w2) be the number of times\\nw1 and w2 occur within a distance 5 of each\\nother in the corpus. Then the word embedding\\nfor a word w is a vector of dimension N,\\nwith one coordinate for each dictionary word.\\nThe coordinate corresponding to word w2 is\\nCount 5(w, w2).\\nThe problem with the resulting embedding\\nis that it uses extremely high-dimensional vec-\\ntors. In the LSA article, is was empirically\\ndiscovered that these embeddings can be re-\\nduced to vectors R300 by doing a rank-300 SVD\\non the NxN original embeddings matrix.\\nThis method was later reﬁned with reweight-\\ning heuristics, such as taking the loga-\\nrithm, or Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)\\n[Kenneth et al., 1990] on the count, which is a\\nvery popular method.\\nThe second family of methods, sometimes\\nalso referred as neural probabilistic language mod-\\nels, had theoretical and some practical appear-\\nance as early as 1986 [ Hinton, 1986], but ﬁrst\\nto show the utility of pre-trained word em-\\nbeddings were arguably Collobert and Weston\\nin 2008 [ Collobert and Weston, 2008]. Unlike\\ncount-based models, predictive models try to\\npredict a word from its neighbors in terms of\\nlearned small, dense embedding vectors.\\nTwo of the most popular methods which\\nappeared recently are the Glove (Global\\nVectors for Word Representation) method\\n2'),\n",

Word2Vec\\nWord2vec is a particularly computationally-\\nefﬁcient predictive model for learning word\\nembeddings from raw text. It comes in two\\nﬂavors, the Continuous Bag-of-Words model\\n(CBOW) and the Skip-Gram model. Algo-\\nrithmically, these models are similar, except\\nthat CBOW predicts target words (e.g. ’mat’)\\nfrom source context words (’the cat sits on\\nthe’), while the skip-gram does the inverse\\nand predicts source context-words from the\\ntarget words. In the skip-gram model (see ﬁg-\\nFigure 2: The Skip-gram model architecture\\nure 2) a neural network is trained over a large\\ncorpus in where the training objective is to\\nlearn word vector representations that are good\\nat predicting the nearby words. The method\\nis also using a simpliﬁed version of NCE\\n[Gutmann and HyvÃd’rinen, 2012] called Neg-\\native sampling where the objective function is\\ndeﬁned as follows:\\nlog σ(v′T\\nwO vwI ) +\\nk\\n∑\\ni=1\\nEwi∼Pn (w)[σ(−v′T\\nwi vwI )]\\n(1)\\nwhere v′\\nw and vw are the \"input\" and \"output\"\\nvector representations of w, σ is the sigmoid\\nfunction but can also be seen as the network\\nparameters function, and Pn is some noise prob-\\nability used to sample random words. In the\\narticle they recommend k to be between 5 to 20,\\nwhile the context of predicted words should be\\n5 or 10. This above objective is later put in the\\nSkip-Gram objective (equtaion 2) to produce\\noptimal word embeddings.\\n1\\nT\\nT\\n∑\\nt=1\\n∑\\n−c≤j≤c,j̸=0\\nlogp (wt+j|wt) (2)\\nThis objective enables the model to differentiate\\ndata from noise by means of logistic regression,\\nthus learning high-quality vector representa-\\ntions.\\nThe CBOW does exactly the same but the di-\\nrection is inverted. In other words the CBOW\\ntrains a binary logistic classiﬁer where, given a\\nwindow of context words, gives a higher proba-\\nbility to \"correct\" if the next word is correct and\\na higher probability to \"incorrect\" if the next\\nword is a random sampled one. Notice that\\nCBOW smoothes over a lot of the distributional\\ninformation (by treating an entire context as\\none observation). For the most part, this turns\\nout to be a useful thing for smaller datasets.\\nHowever, skip-gram treats each context-target\\npair as a new observation, and this tends to do\\nbetter when we have larger datasets.\\nFinally the vector we used in our work had\\na dimension of 300. The Network was trained\\non the Google News dataset which contains 30\\nbillion training words, with negative sampling\\nas mentioned above.

Word Embeddings Properties\\nSimilarity: The simplest property of embed-\\ndings obtained by all the methods described\\nabove is that similar words tend to have sim-\\nilar vectors. More formally, the similarity be-\\ntween two words (as rated by humans on a\\n[-1,1] scale) correlates with the cosine similar-\\nity between those words’ vectors. The fact that\\nFigure 4: What words have embeddings closest to a\\ngiven word? From [Collobert et al., 2011]\\nwords embedding are related to their context-\\nwords stand behind the similarity property\\n3http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata\\nas naturally, similar words tend to appear in\\nsimilar context. This, however creates the\\nproblem that antonyms (e.g. cold and hot\\netc.) also appear with the same context while\\nthey are, by deﬁnition, have opposite mean-\\ning. In [ Mikolov et. al., 2013 ] the score of the\\n(accept,reject) pair is 0.73, and the score of\\n(long,short) is 0.71.\\nThe problem of antonyms was tackled di-\\nrectly by [ Schwartz et al., 2015]. In this arti-\\ncle, the authors introduce a symmetric pattern\\nbased approach to word representation which\\nis particularly suitable for capturing word sim-\\nilarity. Symmetric patterns are a special type\\nof patterns that contain exactly two wildcards\\nand that tend to be instantiated by wildcard\\npairs such that each member of the pair can\\ntake the X or the Y position. For example, the\\nsymmetry of the pattern \"X or Y\" is exempli-\\nﬁed by the semantically plausible expressions\\n\"cats or dogs\" and \"dogs or cats\". Speciﬁcally\\nit was found that two patterns are particularly\\nindicative of antonymy - \"from X to Y\" and\\n\"either X or Y\".\\nUsing their model the authors were able\\nto achieve a ρ score of 0.56 on the simlex999\\ndataset [ Hill et al., 2016], improving state-of-\\nthe-art word2vec skip-gram model results by\\nas much as 5.5-16.7%.

From\\n[Mikolov et. al., 2013]\\nAn interesting theoretical work on non-linear\\nembeddings (especially PMI) was done by\\n[Arora et al., 2015]. In their article they sug-\\ngest that the creation of a textual corpus is\\ndriven by the random walk of a discourse vec-\\ntor ct ∈ℜd, which is a unit vector whose direc-\\ntion in space represents what is being talked\\nabout. Each word has a (time-invariant) la-\\ntent vector vw ∈ℜd that captures its correla-\\ntions with the discourse vector. Using a word\\nproduction model they predict that words oc-\\ncurring at successive time steps will also tend\\nto have vectors that are close together, thus\\nexplaining why similar words have similar vec-\\ntors.\\nUsing the above model the authors introduce\\nthe \"RELATIONS = DIRECTIONS\" notion for\\nlinear analogies. The authors claim that for\\neach relation R, some direction µR can be found\\nwhich satisﬁes some equation. This leads to\\nthe ﬁnding that given enough examples of a\\nrelationship R, it is possible to compute µR us-\\ning SVD and then given a pair of words with a\\nrealtion R and a word c, ﬁnd the best analogy\\nwith word d by ﬁnding the pair c and d such\\nthat vc −vd has highest possible projection over\\nµR. In this way, thay also explain that low di-\\nmension of the vectors has a \"purifying\" effect\\nthat reduces the effect of the overﬁtting coming\\nfrom the PMI approximation, thus achieving\\nmuch better results than higher dimensional\\nvectors.\\nv. Word Embeddings Extensions\\nIn this last subsection we will review two inter-\\nesting works that extend the word embedding\\nconcept to phrases and sentences using differ-\\nent approaches.\\nIn [ Mitchell and Lapata, 2008] the authors\\naddress the problem that vector-based mod-\\nels are typically directed at representing words\\nin isolation and methods for constructing rep-\\nresentations for phrases or sentences have re-\\nceived little attention in the literature. The\\nauthors suggests the use of two composition\\noperations, multiplication and addition (and\\ntheir combination). This way the authors are\\nable to combine word embeddings into phrase\\nor sentences embeddings while taking into ac-\\ncount important properties like word order\\nand semantic relationship between words (i.e.\\nsemantic composition types).\\nIn MIL (Multi Instance Transfer Learning)\\n[Kotzias et al., 2014] the authors propose a neu-\\nral network model which learns embedding\\nat increasing level of hierarchy, starting from\\nword embeddings, going to sentences and end-\\ning with entire document embeddings. The au-\\nthors then use transfer learning by pulling the\\nsentence or word embedding that were trained\\nas part of the document embeddings and use\\nthem for sentence or word review classiﬁcation\\nor similarity tasks (See ﬁgure 6 below).\\nIII. W ord Embeddings vs. Image\\nEmbeddings\\ni. Image Embeddings\\nImage embeddings, or image features, were\\nwildly used for most image processing and\\nclassiﬁcation tasks until the early 2010’s.

As those Convolutional\\nNeural Networks (CNN) operated directly on\\nthe images, it was suggested that these net-\\nworks learn the best image features for the spe-\\nciﬁc task that they are trained for, thus obviat-\\ning the need for speciﬁc hand-crafted features.\\nFigure 7: The CNN architecture of AlexNet\\nIn recent years though, an extensive research\\nwas done on the nature and usage of the ker-\\nnels and features learned by CNN’s. Exten-\\nsive study of CNN feature layers was done\\nin [Zeiler and Fergus, 2014] where they empir-\\nically conﬁrmed that each convolutional layer\\nof the CNN learns a set of ﬁlters. Their ex-\\nperiments also conﬁrm that ﬁlters complexity\\nand expressive power is rising from layer to\\nlayer (i.e. as the network goes deeper) starting\\nfrom simple edge detectors to complex objects\\ndetectors like eyes, ﬂowers, faces and more.\\nThe authors also suggest using the pre-trained\\none before last layer as a feature map, or Image\\nEmbeddings input for simpler SVM classiﬁers.\\nAnother popular work was done a bit\\nearlier in [ Yangqing et al., 2014] where they\\nalso used a pre-trained CNN features as a\\nbase for visual recognition tasks. This work\\nwas followed by several works with one of\\nthem being considered the philosophical fa-\\nther of the algorithm we implement later. In\\n[Razavian et al., 2014] the authors used the\\none before last layer of a network similar to\\nAlexNet that was pre-trained on ImageNet\\n[Russakovsky et al., 2015] as image embed-\\ndings. The authors were able to acheive state-\\nof-art results on several recognition tasks, us-\\ning simple classiﬁers like SVM. The result was\\nsurprising due to the fact that the CNN model\\nwas originally optimized for the task of object\\nclassiﬁcation in ILSVRC 2013 dataset. Never-\\ntheless, it showed itself to be a strong competi-\\ntor to the more sophisticated and highly tuned\\nstate-of-the-art methods.\\nThese works and others suggested that given\\na large enough database of images, a CNN can\\nlearn an image embedding which captures the\\n\"essence\" of the picture and can be used later\\nas an input to different tasks, similar to what\\nis done with word embeddings.\\nii. Similarities and Differences\\nAs we saw earlier Word embedding and Im-\\nage embeddings are similar in the sense that\\nwhile they are being learned as part of a spe-\\nciﬁc task, they can be successfully used later\\nfor a variety of other tasks. Also, in both cases,\\nsimilar images or words will usually have sim-\\nilar embeddings. However Word embeddings\\nand image embeddings differ in some aspects.\\nThe ﬁrst difference is that while word embed-\\ndings depends mostly on the words surround-\\ning the given word, image embeddings usually\\nrely on the speciﬁc image itself. This might ex-\\nplain the fact that linear analogies does not ap-\\npear naturally in images. An interesting work\\nwas done in [Reed et al., 2015] where a neural\\nnetwork is trained to make visual analogies\\n6'),\n",

Those em-\\nbeddings are still useful as they contain a lot\\nof information that is extracted from the image\\nand can be used easily.\\nLastly, we notice that word embeddings are\\ntrained on a speciﬁc corpus where the ﬁnal\\nembedding results come as the form of word-\\nvectors. This limits the embedding to be valid\\nonly for words that were found in the original\\ncorpus while other words will need to be ini-\\ntialized as random vectors (as also done in our\\nwork). In images on the other hand, the em-\\nbeddings come as a pre-trained model where\\nfeatures or embeddings can be pulled for any\\nsort of image by feeding the model with the\\nimage, making image embeddings models a\\nbit more robust (although they might subjected\\nto other constraints like size and image type).\\niii. Joint Word-Image Embeddings\\nTo conclude this part we will review some\\nof the recent work done in the exciting area\\nof joint word-image embeddings. The ﬁrst\\nimmediate usage of joint word-image embed-\\ndings is image annotations or image label-\\ning. An early notable work was done by\\n[Weston, et al., 2010] where a representation\\nof images and representation of annotations\\nwhere both mapped to a joint feature space by\\nlearning a mapping which optimizes top-of-\\nthe-list ranking measures for images and an-\\nnotations. This method, however, learns linear\\nmappings from image features to the embed-\\nding space, and the available labels were only\\nthose provided in the image training set. It\\ncould thus not generalize to new classes.\\nIn 2014 DeVise (A Deep Visual-Semantic\\nEmbedding Model) model was shown by\\n[Frome et al., 2013]. This work which con-\\ntinued earlier work [ Socher et al., 2013 ], com-\\nbined image embedding and word embedding\\ntrained separately into joint similarity metric\\n(see ﬁgure 8). This enabled them to give perfor-\\nmance comparable to a state-of-the-art softmax\\nbased model on a ﬂat object classiﬁcation met-\\nric, while simultaneously making more seman-\\ntically reasonable errors. Their model was also\\nable to make correct predictions across thou-\\nsands of previously unseen classes by lever-\\naging semantic knowledge elicited only from\\nun-annotated text.\\nAnother line of works which combines im-\\nage and words embeddings is the image cap-\\ntioning area. In this area the embeddings are\\nusually not combined into a joint space but\\nrather used together to create captions for im-\\nages. In [Karpathy and Fei Fei, 2015 ] an image\\nFigure 8: : (a) Left: a visual object categorization network with a softmax output layer; Right: a skip-gram language\\nmodel; Center: the joint model, which is initialized with parameters pre-trained at the lower layers of the\\nother two models.

CNN for Sentence\\nClassification Model\\nIn this section and the following we are going\\nto represent our implementation of The Convo-\\nlutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classiﬁ-\\ncation model [Kim ,2014] and our results. This\\nmodel gained much popularity since it was\\nﬁrst introduced in late 2014, mainly because it\\nprovides a very strong demonstration for the\\npower of pre-trained word embeddings.\\nThe model and results were examined in de-\\ntail in [ Zhang and Wallace, 2015] where they\\ntest many types of conﬁgurations for the model,\\nincluding different sizes and number of ﬁlters,\\ndifferent activation units and different word\\nembbeddings.\\nA partial implementation of the model was\\ndone in Theano framework by the authors 4\\nand another simpliﬁed version of the model\\nwas done in TensorFlow 5. In our work we\\nused small parts of the mentioned codes, how-\\never most of the code had to be re-written and\\nexpanded in order to perform a true implmen-\\ntation of the article’s model.\\ni. Model details\\nThe model architecture, shown in ﬁgure 10,\\nis a slight variant of the CNN architecture of\\n[Collobert et al., 2011]. Formally, let xi ∈ℜk\\nbe the k-dimensional word vector correspond-\\ning to the i-th word in the sentence. Let n be\\nthe length (in number of words) of the longest\\nsentence in the dataset, and let lh be the width\\nof the widest ﬁlter in the network. Then, the\\ninput to the network is a k ×(n + lh −1) ma-\\ntrix, which is a concatenation of the word em-\\nbeddings vectors of each sentences, padded\\nby lh −1 zero vectors in the beginning and\\nsome more zero vectors in the end so there are\\nn + lh −1 vectors eventually.\\nThe input of the network is convolved with\\nﬁlters of different widths (i.e. number of words\\nin the window) and different sizes (i.e. number\\nof features). For example, a feature ci is gen-\\nerated from a window of words xi:i+h−1 by a\\nﬁlter with width h is:\\nci = f (wxi:i+h−1 + b) (3)\\nwhere w are the ﬁlter weights, b is a bias term\\n4https://github.com/yoonkim/CNN_sentence\\n5https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-\\nclassiﬁcation-tf\\n8'),\n",

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices Kand V. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations.

Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network.

Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [17] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate= d−0.5\\nmodel ·min(step_num−0.5,step_num·warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_stepstraining steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps= 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized.

Traditional object detection\\nmethods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable\\narchitectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing\\ncomplex ensembles which combine multiple low-level image\\nfeatures with high-level context from object detectors and scene\\nclassiﬁers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more\\npowerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level,\\ndeeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing\\nin traditional architectures. These models behave differently\\nin network architecture, training strategy and optimization\\nfunction, etc. In this paper, we provide a review on deep\\nlearning based object detection frameworks. Our review begins\\nwith a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and\\nits representative tool, namely Convolutional Neural Network\\n(CNN). Then we focus on typical generic object detection\\narchitectures along with some modiﬁcations and useful tricks\\nto improve detection performance further. As distinct speciﬁc\\ndetection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also brieﬂy\\nsurvey several speciﬁc tasks, including salient object detection,\\nface detection and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses\\nare also provided to compare various methods and draw some\\nmeaningful conclusions. Finally, several promising directions and\\ntasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in\\nboth object detection and relevant neural network based learning\\nsystems.\\nIndex Terms—deep learning, object detection, neural network\\nI. I NTRODUCTION\\nT\\nO gain a complete image understanding, we should not\\nonly concentrate on classifying different images, but\\nalso try to precisely estimate the concepts and locations of\\nobjects contained in each image. This task is referred as object\\ndetection [1][S1], which usually consists of different subtasks\\nsuch as face detection [2][S2], pedestrian detection [3][S2]\\nand skeleton detection [4][S3]. As one of the fundamental\\ncomputer vision problems, object detection is able to provide\\nvaluable information for semantic understanding of images\\nand videos, and is related to many applications, including\\nimage classiﬁcation [5], [6], human behavior analysis [7][S4],\\nface recognition [8][S5] and autonomous driving [9], [10].\\nMeanwhile, Inheriting from neural networks and related learn-\\ning systems, the progress in these ﬁelds will develop neural\\nnetwork algorithms, and will also have great impacts on object\\ndetection techniques which can be considered as learning\\nsystems. [11]–[14][S6]. However, due to large variations in\\nviewpoints, poses, occlusions and lighting conditions, it’s difﬁ-\\ncult to perfectly accomplish object detection with an additional\\nZhong-Qiu Zhao, Peng Zheng and Shou-Tao Xu are with the College of\\nComputer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technol-\\nogy, China.

So much attention has been attracted\\nto this ﬁeld in recent years [15]–[18].\\nThe problem deﬁnition of object detection is to determine\\nwhere objects are located in a given image (object localization)\\nand which category each object belongs to (object classiﬁca-\\ntion). So the pipeline of traditional object detection models\\ncan be mainly divided into three stages: informative region\\nselection, feature extraction and classiﬁcation.\\nInformative region selection. As different objects may appear\\nin any positions of the image and have different aspect ratios\\nor sizes, it is a natural choice to scan the whole image with a\\nmulti-scale sliding window. Although this exhaustive strategy\\ncan ﬁnd out all possible positions of the objects, its short-\\ncomings are also obvious. Due to a large number of candidate\\nwindows, it is computationally expensive and produces too\\nmany redundant windows. However, if only a ﬁxed number of\\nsliding window templates are applied, unsatisfactory regions\\nmay be produced.\\nFeature extraction. To recognize different objects, we need\\nto extract visual features which can provide a semantic and\\nrobust representation. SIFT [19], HOG [20] and Haar-like [21]\\nfeatures are the representative ones. This is due to the fact\\nthat these features can produce representations associated with\\ncomplex cells in human brain [19]. However, due to the diver-\\nsity of appearances, illumination conditions and backgrounds,\\nit’s difﬁcult to manually design a robust feature descriptor to\\nperfectly describe all kinds of objects.\\nClassiﬁcation. Besides, a classiﬁer is needed to distinguish\\na target object from all the other categories and to make the\\nrepresentations more hierarchical, semantic and informative\\nfor visual recognition. Usually, the Supported Vector Machine\\n(SVM) [22], AdaBoost [23] and Deformable Part-based Model\\n(DPM) [24] are good choices. Among these classiﬁers, the\\nDPM is a ﬂexible model by combining object parts with\\ndeformation cost to handle severe deformations. In DPM, with\\nthe aid of a graphical model, carefully designed low-level\\nfeatures and kinematically inspired part decompositions are\\ncombined. And discriminative learning of graphical models\\nallows for building high-precision part-based models for a\\nvariety of object classes.\\nBased on these discriminant local feature descriptors and\\nshallow learnable architectures, state of the art results have\\nbeen obtained on PASCAL VOC object detection competition\\n[25] and real-time embedded systems have been obtained with\\na low burden on hardware. However, small gains are obtained\\nduring 2010-2012 by only building ensemble systems and\\nemploying minor variants of successful methods [15]. This fact\\nis due to the following reasons: 1) The generation of candidate\\nbounding boxes with a sliding window strategy is redundant,\\ninefﬁcient and inaccurate. 2) The semantic gap cannot be\\narXiv:1807.05511v2  [cs.CV]  16 Apr 2019'),\n",

A B RIEF OVERVIEW OF DEEP LEARNING\\nPrior to overview on deep learning based object detection\\napproaches, we provide a review on the history of deep\\nlearning along with an introduction on the basic architecture\\nand advantages of CNN.\\nA. The History: Birth, Decline and Prosperity\\nDeep models can be referred to as neural networks with\\ndeep structures. The history of neural networks can date back\\nto 1940s [35], and the original intention was to simulate the\\nhuman brain system to solve general learning problems in a\\nprincipled way. It was popular in 1980s and 1990s with the\\nproposal of back-propagation algorithm by Hinton et al. [36].\\nHowever, due to the overﬁtting of training, lack of large scale\\ntraining data, limited computation power and insigniﬁcance\\nin performance compared with other machine learning tools,\\nneural networks fell out of fashion in early 2000s.\\nDeep learning has become popular since 2006 [37][S7] with\\na break through in speech recognition [38]. The recovery of\\ndeep learning can be attributed to the following factors.\\n•The emergence of large scale annotated training data, such\\nas ImageNet [39], to fully exhibit its very large learning\\ncapacity;\\n•Fast development of high performance parallel computing\\nsystems, such as GPU clusters;\\n•Signiﬁcant advances in the design of network structures\\nand training strategies. With unsupervised and layerwise\\npre-training guided by Auto-Encoder (AE) [40] or Re-\\nstricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [41], a good initializa-\\ntion is provided. With dropout and data augmentation, the\\noverﬁtting problem in training has been relieved [6], [42].\\nWith batch normalization (BN), the training of very deep\\nneural networks becomes quite efﬁcient [43]. Meanwhile,\\nvarious network structures, such as AlexNet [6], Overfeat\\n[44], GoogLeNet [45], VGG [46] and ResNet [47], have\\nbeen extensively studied to improve the performance.\\nWhat prompts deep learning to have a huge impact on the\\nentire academic community? It may owe to the contribution of\\nHinton’s group, whose continuous efforts have demonstrated\\nthat deep learning would bring a revolutionary breakthrough\\non grand challenges rather than just obvious improvements on\\nsmall datasets. Their success results from training a large CNN\\non 1.2 million labeled images together with a few techniques\\n[6] (e.g., ReLU operation [48] and ‘dropout’ regularization).\\nB. Architecture and Advantages of CNN\\nCNN is the most representative model of deep learning [26].\\nA typical CNN architecture, which is referred to as VGG16,'),\n",

Each layer of CNN is known as a\\nfeature map. The feature map of the input layer is a 3D matrix\\nof pixel intensities for different color channels (e.g. RGB). The\\nfeature map of any internal layer is an induced multi-channel\\nimage, whose ‘pixel’ can be viewed as a speciﬁc feature. Every\\nneuron is connected with a small portion of adjacent neurons\\nfrom the previous layer (receptive ﬁeld). Different types of\\ntransformations [6], [49], [50] can be conducted on feature\\nmaps, such as ﬁltering and pooling. Filtering (convolution)\\noperation convolutes a ﬁlter matrix (learned weights) with\\nthe values of a receptive ﬁeld of neurons and takes a non-\\nlinear function (such as sigmoid [51], ReLU) to obtain ﬁnal\\nresponses. Pooling operation, such as max pooling, average\\npooling, L2-pooling and local contrast normalization [52],\\nsummaries the responses of a receptive ﬁeld into one value\\nto produce more robust feature descriptions.\\nWith an interleave between convolution and pooling, an\\ninitial feature hierarchy is constructed, which can be ﬁne-tuned\\nin a supervised manner by adding several fully connected (FC)\\nlayers to adapt to different visual tasks. According to the tasks\\ninvolved, the ﬁnal layer with different activation functions [6]\\nis added to get a speciﬁc conditional probability for each\\noutput neuron. And the whole network can be optimized on\\nan objective function (e.g. mean squared error or cross-entropy\\nloss) via the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. The\\ntypical VGG16 has totally 13 convolutional (conv) layers, 3\\nfully connected layers, 3 max-pooling layers and a softmax\\nclassiﬁcation layer. The conv feature maps are produced by\\nconvoluting 3*3 ﬁlter windows, and feature map resolutions\\nare reduced with 2 stride max-pooling layers. An arbitrary test\\nimage of the same size as training samples can be processed\\nwith the trained network. Re-scaling or cropping operations\\nmay be needed if different sizes are provided [6].\\nThe advantages of CNN against traditional methods can be\\nsummarised as follows.\\n•Hierarchical feature representation, which is the multi-\\nlevel representations from pixel to high-level semantic fea-\\ntures learned by a hierarchical multi-stage structure [15],\\n[53], can be learned from data automatically and hidden\\nfactors of input data can be disentangled through multi-level\\nnonlinear mappings.\\n• Compared with traditional shallow models, a deeper\\narchitecture provides an exponentially increased expressive\\ncapability.\\n• The architecture of CNN provides an opportunity to\\njointly optimize several related tasks together (e.g. Fast R-\\nCNN combines classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\ninto a multi-task leaning manner).\\n• Beneﬁtting from the large learning capacity of deep\\nCNNs, some classical computer vision challenges can be\\nrecast as high-dimensional data transform problems and\\nsolved from a different viewpoint.\\nDue to these advantages, CNN has been widely applied\\ninto many research ﬁelds, such as image super-resolution\\nreconstruction [54], [55], image classiﬁcation [5], [56], im-\\nage retrieval [57], [58], face recognition [8][S5], pedestrian\\ndetection [59]–[61] and video analysis [62], [63].\\nIII. G ENERIC OBJECT DETECTION\\nGeneric object detection aims at locating and classifying\\nexisting objects in any one image, and labeling them with\\nrectangular bounding boxes to show the conﬁdences of exis-\\ntence. The frameworks of generic object detection methods\\ncan mainly be categorized into two types (see Figure 2).\\nOne follows traditional object detection pipeline, generating\\nregion proposals at ﬁrst and then classifying each proposal into\\ndifferent object categories. The other regards object detection\\nas a regression or classiﬁcation problem, adopting a uniﬁed\\nframework to achieve ﬁnal results (categories and locations)\\ndirectly. The region proposal based methods mainly include\\nR-CNN [15], SPP-net [64], Fast R-CNN [16], Faster R-CNN\\n[18], R-FCN [65], FPN [66] and Mask R-CNN [67], some of\\nwhich are correlated with each other (e.g. SPP-net modiﬁes R-\\nCNN with a SPP layer). The regression /classiﬁcation based\\nmethods mainly includes MultiBox [68], AttentionNet [69],\\nG-CNN [70], YOLO [17], SSD [71], YOLOv2 [72], DSSD\\n[73] and DSOD [74]. The correlations between these two\\npipelines are bridged by the anchors introduced in Faster R-\\nCNN. Details of these methods are as follows.\\nA. Region Proposal Based Framework\\nThe region proposal based framework, a two-step process,\\nmatches the attentional mechanism of human brain to some\\nextent, which gives a coarse scan of the whole scenario ﬁrstly\\nand then focuses on regions of interest. Among the pre-related\\nworks [44], [75], [76], the most representative one is Overfeat\\n[44]. This model inserts CNN into sliding window method,\\nwhich predicts bounding boxes directly from locations of\\nthe topmost feature map after obtaining the conﬁdences of\\nunderlying object categories.\\n1) R-CNN: It is of signiﬁcance to improve the quality of\\ncandidate bounding boxes and to take a deep architecture to\\nextract high-level features. To solve these problems, R-CNN\\n[15] was proposed by Ross Girshick in 2014 and obtained a\\nmean average precision (mAP) of 53.3% with more than 30%\\nimprovement over the previous best result (DPM HSC [77]) on\\nPASCAL VOC 2012. Figure 3 shows the ﬂowchart of R-CNN,\\nwhich can be divided into three stages as follows.\\nRegion proposal generation. The R-CNN adopts selective\\nsearch [78] to generate about 2k region proposals for each\\nimage. The selective search method relies on simple bottom-up\\ngrouping and saliency cues to provide more accurate candidate\\nboxes of arbitrary sizes quickly and to reduce the searching\\nspace in object detection [24], [39].\\nCNN based deep feature extraction. In this stage, each\\nregion proposal is warped or cropped into a ﬁxed resolution\\nand the CNN module in [6] is utilized to extract a 4096-\\ndimensional feature as the ﬁnal representation. Due to large\\nlearning capacity, dominant expressive power and hierarchical\\nstructure of CNNs, a high-level, semantic and robust feature\\nrepresentation for each region proposal can be obtained.\\nClassiﬁcation and localization. With pre-trained category-\\nspeciﬁc linear SVMs for multiple classes, different region pro-\\nposals are scored on a set of positive regions and background\\n(negative) regions. The scored regions are then adjusted with'),\n",

The best-performing methods are complex en-\\nsemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level\\nimage features with high-level context. In this paper, we\\npropose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that im-\\nproves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30%\\nrelative to the previous best result on VOC 2012—achieving\\na mAP of 53.3%.

The last decade of progress on various\\nvisual recognition tasks has been based considerably on the\\nuse of SIFT [26] and HOG [7]. But if we look at perfor-\\nmance on the canonical visual recognition task, PASCAL\\nVOC object detection [12], it is generally acknowledged\\nthat progress has been slow during 2010-2012, with small\\ngains obtained by building ensemble systems and employ-\\ning minor variants of successful methods.\\nSIFT and HOG are blockwise orientation histograms,\\na representation we could associate roughly with complex\\ncells in V1, the ﬁrst cortical area in the primate visual path-\\nway. But we also know that recognition occurs several\\nstages downstream, which suggests that there might be hier-\\narchical, multi-stage processes for computing features that\\nare even more informative for visual recognition.\\nFukushima’s “neocognitron” [16], a biologically-\\n1.

Our system (1)\\ntakes an input image, (2) extracts around 2000 bottom-up region\\nproposals, (3) computes features for each proposal using a large\\nconvolutional neural network (CNN), and then (4) classiﬁes each\\nregion using class-speciﬁc linear SVMs. R-CNN achieves a mean\\naverage precision (mAP) of 53.7% on PASCAL VOC 2010. For\\ncomparison, [32] reports 35.1% mAP using the same region pro-\\nposals, but with a spatial pyramid and bag-of-visual-words ap-\\nproach. The popular deformable part models perform at 33.4%.\\ninspired hierarchical and shift-invariant model for pattern\\nrecognition, was an early attempt at just such a process.\\nThe neocognitron, however, lacked a supervised training al-\\ngorithm. LeCun et al. [23] provided the missing algorithm\\nby showing that stochastic gradient descent, via backprop-\\nagation, can train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a\\nclass of models that extend the neocognitron.\\nCNNs saw heavy use in the 1990s ( e.g., [24]), but then\\nfell out of fashion, particularly in computer vision, with the\\nrise of support vector machines. In 2012, Krizhevsky et al.\\n[22] rekindled interest in CNNs by showing substantially\\nhigher image classiﬁcation accuracy on the ImageNet Large\\nScale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) [9, 10].\\nTheir success resulted from training a large CNN on 1.2\\nmillion labeled images, together with a few twists on Le-\\nCun’s CNN (e.g., max(x, 0) rectifying non-linearities and\\n“dropout” regularization).\\nThe signiﬁcance of the ImageNet result was vigorously\\ndebated during the ILSVRC 2012 workshop. The central\\nissue can be distilled to the following: To what extent do\\nthe CNN classiﬁcation results on ImageNet generalize to\\nobject detection results on the PASCAL VOC Challenge?\\nWe answer this question decisively by bridging the\\nchasm between image classiﬁcation and object detection.\\nThis paper is the ﬁrst to show that a CNN can lead to dra-\\n1\\nFig. 3. The ﬂowchart of R-CNN [15], which consists of 3 stages: (1) extracts\\nbottom-up region proposals, (2) computes features for each proposal using a\\nCNN, and then (3) classiﬁes each region with class-speciﬁc linear SVMs.\\nbounding box regression and ﬁltered with a greedy non-\\nmaximum suppression (NMS) to produce ﬁnal bounding boxes\\nfor preserved object locations.\\nWhen there are scarce or insufﬁcient labeled data, pre-\\ntraining is usually conducted. Instead of unsupervised pre-\\ntraining [79], R-CNN ﬁrstly conducts supervised pre-training\\non ILSVRC, a very large auxiliary dataset, and then takes a\\ndomain-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning. This scheme has been adopted by\\nmost of subsequent approaches [16], [18].\\nIn spite of its improvements over traditional methods and\\nsigniﬁcance in bringing CNN into practical object detection,\\nthere are still some disadvantages.\\n•Due to the existence of FC layers, the CNN requires a\\nﬁxed-size (e.g., 227×227) input image, which directly leads\\nto the re-computation of the whole CNN for each evaluated\\nregion, taking a great deal of time in the testing period.\\n•Training of R-CNN is a multi-stage pipeline. At ﬁrst,\\na convolutional network (ConvNet) on object proposals is\\nﬁne-tuned. Then the softmax classiﬁer learned by ﬁne-\\ntuning is replaced by SVMs to ﬁt in with ConvNet features.\\nFinally, bounding-box regressors are trained.\\n• Training is expensive in space and time. Features are\\nextracted from different region proposals and stored on the\\ndisk. It will take a long time to process a relatively small\\ntraining set with very deep networks, such as VGG16. At the\\nsame time, the storage memory required by these features\\nshould also be a matter of concern.\\n•Although selective search can generate region proposals\\nwith relatively high recalls, the obtained region proposals\\nare still redundant and this procedure is time-consuming\\n(around 2 seconds to extract 2k region proposals).\\nTo solve these problems, many methods have been pro-\\nposed. GOP [80] takes a much faster geodesic based segmen-\\ntation to replace traditional graph cuts. MCG [81] searches\\ndifferent scales of the image for multiple hierarchical segmen-\\ntations and combinatorially groups different regions to produce\\nproposals. Instead of extracting visually distinct segments,\\nthe edge boxes method [82] adopts the idea that objects are\\nmore likely to exist in bounding boxes with fewer contours\\nstraggling their boundaries. Also some researches tried to\\nre-rank or reﬁne pre-extracted region proposals to remove\\nunnecessary ones and obtained a limited number of valuable\\nones, such as DeepBox [83] and SharpMask [84].\\nIn addition, there are some improvements to solve the\\nproblem of inaccurate localization. Zhang et al. [85] utilized\\na bayesian optimization based search algorithm to guide\\nthe regressions of different bounding boxes sequentially, and\\ntrained class-speciﬁc CNN classiﬁers with a structured loss\\nto penalize the localization inaccuracy explicitly. Saurabh\\nGupta et al. improved object detection for RGB-D images\\nwith semantically rich image and depth features [86], and\\nlearned a new geocentric embedding for depth images to\\nencode each pixel. The combination of object detectors and\\nsuperpixel classiﬁcation framework gains a promising result\\non semantic scene segmentation task. Ouyang et al. proposed\\na deformable deep CNN (DeepID-Net) [87] which introduces\\na novel deformation constrained pooling (def-pooling) layer\\nto impose geometric penalty on the deformation of various\\nobject parts and makes an ensemble of models with different\\nsettings. Lenc et al. [88] provided an analysis on the role\\nof proposal generation in CNN-based detectors and tried to\\nreplace this stage with a constant and trivial region generation\\nscheme. The goal is achieved by biasing sampling to match\\nthe statistics of the ground truth bounding boxes with K-means\\nclustering. However, more candidate boxes are required to\\nachieve comparable results to those of R-CNN.\\n2) SPP-net:FC layers must take a ﬁxed-size input. That’s\\nwhy R-CNN chooses to warp or crop each region proposal\\ninto the same size. However, the object may exist partly in\\nthe cropped region and unwanted geometric distortion may be\\nproduced due to the warping operation. These content losses or\\ndistortions will reduce recognition accuracy, especially when\\nthe scales of objects vary.\\nTo solve this problem, He et al. took the theory of spatial\\npyramid matching (SPM) [89], [90] into consideration and\\nproposed a novel CNN architecture named SPP-net [64]. SPM\\ntakes several ﬁner to coarser scales to partition the image into\\na number of divisions and aggregates quantized local features\\ninto mid-level representations.\\nThe architecture of SPP-net for object detection can be\\nfound in Figure 4.

R-CNN ﬁrst extracts about 2,000 candi-\\ndate windows from each image via selective search\\n[20]. Then the image region in each window is warped\\nto a ﬁxed size (227 ×227). A pre-trained deep network\\nis used to extract the feature of each window. A\\nbinary SVM classiﬁer is then trained on these features\\nfor detection. R-CNN generates results of compelling\\nquality and substantially outperforms previous meth-\\nods. However, because R-CNN repeatedly applies the\\ndeep convolutional network to about 2,000 windows\\nper image, it is time-consuming. Feature extraction is\\nthe major timing bottleneck in testing.\\nOur SPP-net can also be used for object detection.\\nWe extract the feature maps from the entire image\\nonly once (possibly at multiple scales). Then we ap-\\nply the spatial pyramid pooling on each candidate\\nwindow of the feature maps to pool a ﬁxed-length\\nrepresentation of this window (see Figure 5). Because\\nthe time-consuming convolutions are only applied\\nonce, our method can run orders of magnitude faster.\\nOur method extracts window-wise features from\\nregions of the feature maps, while R-CNN extracts\\ndirectly from image regions. In previous works, the\\nDeformable Part Model (DPM) [23] extracts features\\nfrom windows in HOG [24] feature maps, and the\\nSelective Search (SS) method [20] extracts from win-\\ndows in encoded SIFT feature maps. The Overfeat\\ndetection method [5] also extracts from windows of\\ndeep convolutional feature maps, but needs to pre-\\ndeﬁne the window size. On the contrary, our method\\nenables feature extraction in arbitrary windows from\\nthe deep convolutional feature maps.\\nspatial pyramid \\npooling layer\\nfeature maps of conv5\\nconvolutional layers\\nfixed-length representation\\ninput image\\nwindow\\n…...\\nfully-connected layers (fc6, fc7)\\nFigure 5: Pooling features from arbitrary windows\\non feature maps. The feature maps are computed\\nfrom the entire image. The pooling is performed in\\ncandidate windows.\\n4.1 Detection Algorithm\\nWe use the “fast” mode of selective search [20] to\\ngenerate about 2,000 candidate windows per image.\\nThen we resize the image such that min(w,h) = s,\\nand extract the feature maps from the entire image.\\nWe use the SPP-net model of ZF-5 (single-size trained)\\nfor the time being. In each candidate window, we use\\na 4-level spatial pyramid (1 ×1, 2×2, 3×3, 6×6, totally\\n50 bins) to pool the features. This generates a 12,800-\\nd (256 ×50) representation for each window. These\\nrepresentations are provided to the fully-connected\\nlayers of the network. Then we train a binary linear\\nSVM classiﬁer for each category on these features.\\nOur implementation of the SVM training follows\\n[20], [7]. We use the ground-truth windows to gen-\\nerate the positive samples. The negative samples are\\nthose overlapping a positive window by at most 30%\\n(measured by the intersection-over-union (IoU) ratio).\\nAny negative sample is removed if it overlaps another\\nnegative sample by more than 70%. We apply the stan-\\ndard hard negative mining [23] to train the SVM. This\\nstep is iterated once. It takes less than 1 hour to train\\nSVMs for all 20 categories. In testing, the classiﬁer\\nis used to score the candidate windows. Then we use\\nnon-maximum suppression [23] (threshold of 30%) on\\nthe scored windows.\\nOur method can be improved by multi-scale feature\\nextraction. We resize the image such that min(w,h) =\\ns ∈ S = {480,576,688,864,1200}, and compute the\\nfeature maps of conv 5 for each scale. One strategy of\\ncombining the features from these scales is to pool\\nthem channel-by-channel. But we empirically ﬁnd\\nthat another strategy provides better results. For each\\ncandidate window, we choose a single scale s ∈ S\\nsuch that the scaled candidate window has a number\\nof pixels closest to 224 ×224. Then we only use the\\nfeature maps extracted from this scale to compute\\nFig. 4. The architecture of SPP-net for object detection [64].\\nSPPnet also has notable drawbacks. Like R-CNN, train-\\ning is a multi-stage pipeline that involves extracting fea-\\ntures, ﬁne-tuning a network with log loss, training SVMs,\\nand ﬁnally ﬁtting bounding-box regressors. Features are\\nalso written to disk. But unlike R-CNN, the ﬁne-tuning al-\\ngorithm proposed in [\\n11] cannot update the convolutional\\nlayers that precede the spatial pyramid pooling. Unsurpris-\\ningly, this limitation (ﬁxed convolutional layers) limits the\\naccuracy of very deep networks.\\n1.2. Contributions\\nWe propose a new training algorithm that ﬁxes the disad-\\nvantages of R-CNN and SPPnet, while improving on their\\nspeed and accuracy. We call this method Fast R-CNN be-\\ncause it’s comparatively fast to train and test. The Fast R-\\nCNN method has several advantages:\\n1. Higher detection quality (mAP) than R-CNN, SPPnet\\n2. Training is single-stage, using a multi-task loss\\n3. Training can update all network layers\\n4. No disk storage is required for feature caching\\nFast R-CNN is written in Python and C++ (Caffe\\n[\\n13]) and is available under the open-source MIT Li-\\ncense at https://github.com/rbgirshick/\\nfast-rcnn.\\n2. Fast R-CNN architecture and training\\nFig. 1 illustrates the Fast R-CNN architecture. A Fast\\nR-CNN network takes as input an entire image and a set\\nof object proposals. The network ﬁrst processes the whole\\nimage with several convolutional ( conv) and max pooling\\nlayers to produce a conv feature map. Then, for each ob-\\nject proposal a region of interest ( RoI) pooling layer ex-\\ntracts a ﬁxed-length feature vector from the feature map.\\nEach feature vector is fed into a sequence of fully connected\\n(fc) layers that ﬁnally branch into two sibling output lay-\\ners: one that produces softmax probability estimates over\\nK object classes plus a catch-all “background” class and\\nanother layer that outputs four real-valued numbers for each\\nof the K object classes. Each set of 4 values encodes reﬁned\\nbounding-box positions for one of the K classes.\\n2.1. The RoI pooling layer\\nThe RoI pooling layer uses max pooling to convert the\\nfeatures inside any valid region of interest into a small fea-\\nture map with a ﬁxed spatial extent of H × W (e.g., 7 × 7),\\nwhere H and W are layer hyper-parameters that are inde-\\npendent of any particular RoI. In this paper, an RoI is a\\nrectangular window into a conv feature map. Each RoI is\\ndeﬁned by a four-tuple (r, c, h, w ) that speciﬁes its top-left\\ncorner (r, c) and its height and width (h, w ).\\nDeep\\nConvNet\\nConv\\nfeature map\\nRoI\\nprojection\\nRoI\\npooling\\nlayer\\nFCs\\nRoI feature\\nvector\\nsoftmax\\nbbox\\nregressor\\nOutputs:\\nFC FC\\nFor each RoI\\nFigure 1. Fast R-CNN architecture. An input image and multi-\\nple regions of interest (RoIs) are input into a fully convolutional\\nnetwork. Each RoI is pooled into a ﬁxed-size feature map and\\nthen mapped to a feature vector by fully connected layers (FCs).\\nThe network has two output vectors per RoI: softmax probabilities\\nand per-class bounding-box regression offsets. The architecture is\\ntrained end-to-end with a multi-task loss.\\nRoI max pooling works by dividing the h × w RoI win-\\ndow into an H × W grid of sub-windows of approximate\\nsize h/H × w/W and then max-pooling the values in each\\nsub-window into the corresponding output grid cell. Pool-\\ning is applied independently to each feature map channel,\\nas in standard max pooling. The RoI layer is simply the\\nspecial-case of the spatial pyramid pooling layer used in\\nSPPnets [\\n11] in which there is only one pyramid level. We\\nuse the pooling sub-window calculation given in [ 11].\\n2.2. Initializing from pre-trained networks\\nWe experiment with three pre-trained ImageNet [ 4] net-\\nworks, each with ﬁve max pooling layers and between ﬁve\\nand thirteen conv layers (see Section\\n4.1 for network de-\\ntails). When a pre-trained network initializes a Fast R-CNN\\nnetwork, it undergoes three transformations.\\nFirst, the last max pooling layer is replaced by a RoI\\npooling layer that is conﬁgured by setting H and W to be\\ncompatible with the net’s ﬁrst fully connected layer ( e.g.,\\nH = W = 7 for VGG16).\\nSecond, the network’s last fully connected layer and soft-\\nmax (which were trained for 1000-way ImageNet classiﬁ-\\ncation) are replaced with the two sibling layers described\\nearlier (a fully connected layer and softmax over K + 1 cat-\\negories and category-speciﬁc bounding-box regressors).\\nThird, the network is modiﬁed to take two data inputs: a\\nlist of images and a list of RoIs in those images.\\n2.3. Fine-tuning for detection\\nTraining all network weights with back-propagation is an\\nimportant capability of Fast R-CNN. First, let’s elucidate\\nwhy SPPnet is unable to update weights below the spatial\\npyramid pooling layer.\\nThe root cause is that back-propagation through the SPP\\nlayer is highly inefﬁcient when each training sample ( i.e.\\nRoI) comes from a different image, which is exactly how\\nR-CNN and SPPnet networks are trained. The inefﬁciency\\n1441\\nFig. 5. The architecture of Fast R-CNN [16].\\nproposals of arbitrary sizes to ﬁxed-length feature vectors. The\\nfeasibility of the reusability of these feature maps is due to\\nthe fact that the feature maps not only involve the strength of\\nlocal responses, but also have relationships with their spatial\\npositions [64]. The layer after the ﬁnal conv layer is referred\\nto as spatial pyramid pooling layer (SPP layer). If the number\\nof feature maps in conv5 is 256, taking a 3-level pyramid,\\nthe ﬁnal feature vector for each region proposal obtained after\\nSPP layer has a dimension of 256 ×(12 + 22 + 42) = 5376.\\nSPP-net not only gains better results with correct estimation\\nof different region proposals in their corresponding scales, but\\nalso improves detection efﬁciency in testing period with the\\nsharing of computation cost before SPP layer among different\\nproposals.\\n3) Fast R-CNN: Although SPP-net has achieved impressive\\nimprovements in both accuracy and efﬁciency over R-CNN,\\nit still has some notable drawbacks. SPP-net takes almost\\nthe same multi-stage pipeline as R-CNN, including feature\\nextraction, network ﬁne-tuning, SVM training and bounding-\\nbox regressor ﬁtting. So an additional expense on storage space\\nis still required. Additionally, the conv layers preceding the\\nSPP layer cannot be updated with the ﬁne-tuning algorithm\\nintroduced in [64]. As a result, an accuracy drop of very deep\\nnetworks is unsurprising. To this end, Girshick [16] introduced\\na multi-task loss on classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\nand proposed a novel CNN architecture named Fast R-CNN.\\nThe architecture of Fast R-CNN is exhibited in Figure 5.\\nSimilar to SPP-net, the whole image is processed with conv\\nlayers to produce feature maps. Then, a ﬁxed-length feature\\nvector is extracted from each region proposal with a region of\\ninterest (RoI) pooling layer. The RoI pooling layer is a special\\ncase of the SPP layer, which has only one pyramid level. Each\\nfeature vector is then fed into a sequence of FC layers before\\nﬁnally branching into two sibling output layers. One output\\nlayer is responsible for producing softmax probabilities for\\nall C+ 1categories (C object classes plus one ‘background’\\nclass) and the other output layer encodes reﬁned bounding-\\nbox positions with four real-valued numbers. All parameters\\nin these procedures (except the generation of region proposals)\\nare optimized via a multi-task loss in an end-to-end way.\\nThe multi-tasks loss L is deﬁned as below to jointly train\\nclassiﬁcation and bounding-box regression,\\nL(p,u,t u,v) =Lcls(p,u) +λ[u≥1]Lloc(tu,v) (1)\\nwhere Lcls(p,u) =−logpu calculates the log loss for ground\\ntruth class u and pu is driven from the discrete probability\\ndistribution p= (p0,··· ,pC) over the C+1 outputs from the\\nlast FC layer. Lloc(tu,v) is deﬁned over the predicted offsets\\ntu = (tu\\nx,tu\\ny,tu\\nw,tu\\nh) and ground-truth bounding-box regression\\ntargets v = (vx,vy,vw,vh), where x,y,w,h denote the two\\ncoordinates of the box center, width, and height, respectively.\\nEach tu adopts the parameter settings in [15] to specify an\\nobject proposal with a log-space height/width shift and scale-\\ninvariant translation. The Iverson bracket indicator function\\n[u≥1] is employed to omit all background RoIs. To provide\\nmore robustness against outliers and eliminate the sensitivity\\nin exploding gradients, a smooth L1 loss is adopted to ﬁt\\nbounding-box regressors as below\\nLloc(tu,v) =\\n∑\\ni∈x,y,w,h\\nsmoothL1 (tu\\ni −vi) (2)\\nwhere\\nsmoothL1 (x) =\\n{\\n0.5x2 if|x|<1\\n|x|−0.5 otherwise (3)\\nTo accelerate the pipeline of Fast R-CNN, another two tricks\\nare of necessity. On one hand, if training samples (i.e. RoIs)\\ncome from different images, back-propagation through the\\nSPP layer becomes highly inefﬁcient. Fast R-CNN samples\\nmini-batches hierarchically, namely N images sampled ran-\\ndomly at ﬁrst and then R/N RoIs sampled in each image,\\nwhere R represents the number of RoIs. Critically, computa-\\ntion and memory are shared by RoIs from the same image in\\nthe forward and backward pass. On the other hand, much time\\nis spent in computing the FC layers during the forward pass\\n[16]. The truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [91]\\ncan be utilized to compress large FC layers and to accelerate\\nthe testing procedure.\\nIn the Fast R-CNN, regardless of region proposal genera-\\ntion, the training of all network layers can be processed in\\na single-stage with a multi-task loss. It saves the additional\\nexpense on storage space, and improves both accuracy and\\nefﬁciency with more reasonable training schemes.\\n4) Faster R-CNN: Despite the attempt to generate candi-\\ndate boxes with biased sampling [88], state-of-the-art object\\ndetection networks mainly rely on additional methods, such as\\nselective search and Edgebox, to generate a candidate pool of\\nisolated region proposals. Region proposal computation is also\\na bottleneck in improving efﬁciency. To solve this problem,\\nRen et al. introduced an additional Region Proposal Network\\n(RPN) [18], [92], which acts in a nearly cost-free way by\\nsharing full-image conv features with detection network.\\nRPN is achieved with a fully-convolutional network, which\\nhas the ability to predict object bounds and scores at each\\nposition simultaneously. Similar to [78], RPN takes an image\\nof arbitrary size to generate a set of rectangular object propos-\\nals.

Each sliding window is mapped to a lower-dimensional vector (256-d for ZF and 512-d\\nfor VGG). This vector is fed into two sibling fully-connected layers—a box-regression layer ( reg)\\nand a box-classiﬁcation layer ( cls). We use n = 3in this paper, noting that the effective receptive\\nﬁeld on the input image is large (171 and 228 pixels for ZF and VGG, respectively). This mini-\\nnetwork is illustrated at a single position in Fig. 1 (left). Note that because the mini-network operates\\nin a sliding-window fashion, the fully-connected layers are shared across all spatial locations. This\\narchitecture is naturally implemented with an n×nconv layer followed by two sibling 1 ×1 conv\\nlayers (for reg and cls, respectively). ReLUs [15] are applied to the output of the n×nconv layer.\\nTranslation-Invariant Anchors\\nAt each sliding-window location, we simultaneously predict k region proposals, so the reg layer\\nhas 4k outputs encoding the coordinates of k boxes. The cls layer outputs 2k scores that estimate\\nprobability of object / not-object for each proposal. 2 The kproposals are parameterized relative to\\nkreference boxes, called anchors. Each anchor is centered at the sliding window in question, and is\\nassociated with a scale and aspect ratio. We use 3 scales and 3 aspect ratios, yieldingk= 9anchors\\nat each sliding position. For a conv feature map of a sizeW×H(typically ∼2,400), there are WHk\\nanchors in total. An important property of our approach is that it is translation invariant, both in\\nterms of the anchors and the functions that compute proposals relative to the anchors.\\nAs a comparison, the MultiBox method [20] uses k-means to generate 800 anchors, which are not\\ntranslation invariant. If one translates an object in an image, the proposal should translate and the\\nsame function should be able to predict the proposal in either location. Moreover, because the\\nMultiBox anchors are not translation invariant, it requires a (4+1) ×800-dimensional output layer,\\nwhereas our method requires a (4+2)×9-dimensional output layer. Our proposal layers have an order\\nof magnitude fewer parameters (27 million for MultiBox using GoogLeNet [20] vs. 2.4 million for\\nRPN using VGG-16), and thus have less risk of overﬁtting on small datasets, like PASCAL VOC.\\nA Loss Function for Learning Region Proposals\\nFor training RPNs, we assign a binary class label (of being an object or not) to each anchor. We\\nassign a positive label to two kinds of anchors: (i) the anchor/anchors with the highest Intersection-\\nover-Union (IoU) overlap with a ground-truth box, or (ii) an anchor that has an IoU overlap higher\\nthan 0.7 with any ground-truth box. Note that a single ground-truth box may assign positive labels\\nto multiple anchors. We assign a negative label to a non-positive anchor if its IoU ratio is lower than\\n0.3 for all ground-truth boxes. Anchors that are neither positive nor negative do not contribute to the\\ntraining objective.\\nWith these deﬁnitions, we minimize an objective function following the multi-task loss in Fast R-\\nCNN [5]. Our loss function for an image is deﬁned as:\\nL({pi},{ti}) = 1\\nNcls\\n∑\\ni\\nLcls (pi,p∗\\ni ) +λ 1\\nNreg\\n∑\\ni\\np∗\\ni Lreg(ti,t∗\\ni ).

The network\\nslides over the conv feature map and fully connects to an\\nn×n spatial window.

Lcls is a binary\\nlog loss and Lreg is a smoothed L1 loss similar to (2). These\\ntwo terms are normalized with the mini-batch size ( Ncls)\\nand the number of anchor locations ( Nreg ), respectively.

Introduction\\nRecognizing objects at vastly different scales is a fun-\\ndamental challenge in computer vision. Feature pyramids\\nbuilt upon image pyramids (for short we call these featur-\\nized image pyramids) form the basis of a standard solution\\n[1] (Fig. 1(a)). These pyramids are scale-invariant in the\\nsense that an object’s scale change is offset by shifting its\\nlevel in the pyramid. Intuitively, this property enables a\\nmodel to detect objects across a large range of scales by\\nscanning the model over both positions and pyramid levels.\\nFeaturized image pyramids were heavily used in the\\nera of hand-engineered features [5, 25]. They were so\\ncritical that object detectors like DPM [7] required dense\\nscale sampling to achieve good results ( e.g., 10 scales per\\noctave). For recognition tasks, engineered features have\\n(a) Featurized image pyramid\\npredict\\npredict\\npredict\\npredict\\n(b) Single feature map\\npredict\\n(d) Feature Pyramid Network\\npredict\\npredict\\npredict\\n(c) Pyramidal feature hierarchy\\npredict\\npredict\\npredict\\nFigure 1.

Aside from being\\ncapable of representing higher-level semantics, ConvNets\\nare also more robust to variance in scale and thus facilitate\\nrecognition from features computed on a single input scale\\n[15, 11, 29] (Fig. 1(b)). But even with this robustness, pyra-\\nmids are still needed to get the most accurate results. All re-\\ncent top entries in the ImageNet [33] and COCO [21] detec-\\ntion challenges use multi-scale testing on featurized image\\npyramids (e.g., [16, 35]). The principle advantage of fea-\\nturizing each level of an image pyramid is that it produces\\na multi-scale feature representation in which all levels are\\nsemantically strong, including the high-resolution levels.\\nNevertheless, featurizing each level of an image pyra-\\nmid has obvious limitations. Inference time increases con-\\nsiderably (e.g., by four times [11]), making this approach\\nimpractical for real applications.

However, it turns out to be\\ninferior with such a naive solution [47]. This inconsistence is\\ndue to the dilemma of respecting translation variance in object\\ndetection compared with increasing translation invariance in\\nimage classiﬁcation. In other words, shifting an object inside\\nan image should be indiscriminative in image classiﬁcation\\nwhile any translation of an object in a bounding box may\\nbe meaningful in object detection. A manual insertion of\\nthe RoI pooling layer into convolutions can break down\\ntranslation invariance at the expense of additional unshared\\nregion-wise layers. So Li et al. [65] proposed a region-based\\nfully convolutional networks (R-FCN, Fig. S2).\\nDifferent from Faster R-CNN, for each category, the last\\nconv layer of R-FCN produces a total of k2 position-sensitive\\nscore maps with a ﬁxed grid of k×k ﬁrstly and a position-\\nsensitive RoI pooling layer is then appended to aggregate the\\nresponses from these score maps. Finally, in each RoI, k2\\nposition-sensitive scores are averaged to produce a C + 1-d\\nvector and softmax responses across categories are computed.\\nAnother 4k2-d conv layer is appended to obtain class-agnostic\\nbounding boxes.\\nWith R-FCN, more powerful classiﬁcation networks can be\\nadopted to accomplish object detection in a fully-convolutional\\narchitecture by sharing nearly all the layers, and state-of-the-\\nart results are obtained on both PASCAL VOC and Microsoft\\nCOCO [94] datasets at a test speed of 170ms per image.\\n6) FPN: Feature pyramids built upon image pyramids\\n(featurized image pyramids) have been widely applied in\\nmany object detection systems to improve scale invariance\\n[24], [64] (Figure 7(a)). However, training time and memory\\nconsumption increase rapidly. To this end, some techniques\\ntake only a single input scale to represent high-level semantics\\nand increase the robustness to scale changes (Figure 7(b)),\\nand image pyramids are built at test time which results in\\nan inconsistency between train/test-time inferences [16], [18].\\nThe in-network feature hierarchy in a deep ConvNet produces\\nfeature maps of different spatial resolutions while introduces\\nlarge semantic gaps caused by different depths (Figure 7(c)).\\nTo avoid using low-level features, pioneer works [71], [95]\\nusually build the pyramid starting from middle layers or\\njust sum transformed feature responses, missing the higher-'),\n",

The Mask R-CNN framework for instance segmentation [67].\\nresolution maps of the feature hierarchy.\\nDifferent from these approaches, FPN [66] holds an ar-\\nchitecture with a bottom-up pathway, a top-down pathway\\nand several lateral connections to combine low-resolution and\\nsemantically strong features with high-resolution and seman-\\ntically weak features (Figure 7(d)). The bottom-up pathway,\\nwhich is the basic forward backbone ConvNet, produces a\\nfeature hierarchy by downsampling the corresponding feature\\nmaps with a stride of 2. The layers owning the same size of\\noutput maps are grouped into the same network stage and the\\noutput of the last layer of each stage is chosen as the reference\\nset of feature maps to build the following top-down pathway.\\nTo build the top-down pathway, feature maps from higher\\nnetwork stages are upsampled at ﬁrst and then enhanced with\\nthose of the same spatial size from the bottom-up pathway\\nvia lateral connections. A 1 ×1 conv layer is appended to\\nthe upsampled map to reduce channel dimensions and the\\nmergence is achieved by element-wise addition. Finally, a3×3\\nconvolution is also appended to each merged map to reduce\\nthe aliasing effect of upsampling and the ﬁnal feature map is\\ngenerated. This process is iterated until the ﬁnest resolution\\nmap is generated.\\nAs feature pyramid can extract rich semantics from all\\nlevels and be trained end-to-end with all scales, state-of-the-\\nart representation can be obtained without sacriﬁcing speed\\nand memory. Meanwhile, FPN is independent of the backbone\\nCNN architectures and can be applied to different stages of\\nobject detection (e.g. region proposal generation) and to many\\nother computer vision tasks (e.g. instance segmentation).\\n7) Mask R-CNN: Instance segmentation [96] is a challeng-\\ning task which requires detecting all objects in an image and\\nsegmenting each instance (semantic segmentation [97]). These\\ntwo tasks are usually regarded as two independent processes.\\nAnd the multi-task scheme will create spurious edge and\\nexhibit systematic errors on overlapping instances [98]. To\\nsolve this problem, parallel to the existing branches in Faster\\nR-CNN for classiﬁcation and bounding box regression, the\\nMask R-CNN [67] adds a branch to predict segmentation\\nmasks in a pixel-to-pixel manner (Figure 8).\\nDifferent from the other two branches which are inevitably\\ncollapsed into short output vectors by FC layers, the segmen-\\ntation mask branch encodes an m×m mask to maintain the\\nexplicit object spatial layout. This kind of fully convolutional\\nrepresentation requires fewer parameters but is more accurate\\nthan that of [97]. Formally, besides the two losses in (1) for\\nclassiﬁcation and bounding box regression, an additional loss\\nfor segmentation mask branch is deﬁned to reach a multi-task\\nloss. An this loss is only associated with ground-truth class\\nand relies on the classiﬁcation branch to predict the category.\\nBecause RoI pooling, the core operation in Faster R-CNN,\\nperforms a coarse spatial quantization for feature extraction,\\nmisalignment is introduced between the RoI and the features.\\nIt affects classiﬁcation little because of its robustness to small\\ntranslations. However, it has a large negative effect on pixel-\\nto-pixel mask prediction. To solve this problem, Mask R-CNN\\nadopts a simple and quantization-free layer, namely RoIAlign,\\nto preserve the explicit per-pixel spatial correspondence faith-\\nfully. RoIAlign is achieved by replacing the harsh quantization\\nof RoI pooling with bilinear interpolation [99], computing the\\nexact values of the input features at four regularly sampled\\nlocations in each RoI bin. In spite of its simplicity, this\\nseemingly minor change improves mask accuracy greatly,\\nespecially under strict localization metrics.\\nGiven the Faster R-CNN framework, the mask branch only\\nadds a small computational burden and its cooperation with\\nother tasks provides complementary information for object\\ndetection. As a result, Mask R-CNN is simple to implement\\nwith promising instance segmentation and object detection\\nresults. In a word, Mask R-CNN is a ﬂexible and efﬁcient\\nframework for instance-level recognition, which can be easily\\ngeneralized to other tasks (e.g. human pose estimation [7][S4])\\nwith minimal modiﬁcation.\\n8) Multi-task Learning, Multi-scale Representation and\\nContextual Modelling: Although the Faster R-CNN gets\\npromising results with several hundred proposals, it still strug-\\ngles in small-size object detection and localization, mainly due\\nto the coarseness of its feature maps and limited information\\nprovided in particular candidate boxes. The phenomenon is\\nmore obvious on the Microsoft COCO dataset which consists\\nof objects at a broad range of scales, less prototypical images,\\nand requires more precise localization. To tackle these prob-\\nlems, it is of necessity to accomplish object detection with\\nmulti-task learning [100], multi-scale representation [95] and\\ncontext modelling [101] to combine complementary informa-\\ntion from multiple sources.\\nMulti-task Learning learns a useful representation for\\nmultiple correlated tasks from the same input [102], [103].\\nBrahmbhatt et al. introduced conv features trained for ob-\\nject segmentation and ‘stuff’ (amorphous categories such as\\nground and water) to guide accurate object detection of small\\nobjects (StuffNet) [100].

To address this problem,\\nShrivastava et al. proposed an effective online mining algo-\\nrithm (OHEM) [113] for automatic selection of the hard ex-\\namples, which leads to a more effective and efﬁcient training.\\nInstead of concentrating on feature extraction, Ren et al.\\nmade a detailed analysis on object classiﬁers [114], and\\nfound that it is of particular importance for object detection\\nto construct a deep and convolutional per-region classiﬁer\\ncarefully, especially for ResNets [47] and GoogLeNets [45].\\nTraditional CNN framework for object detection is not\\nskilled in handling signiﬁcant scale variation, occlusion or\\ntruncation, especially when only 2D object detection is in-\\nvolved.

As a result, the time spent in\\nhandling different components becomes the bottleneck in real-\\ntime application.\\nOne-step frameworks based on global regres-\\nsion/classiﬁcation, mapping straightly from image pixels\\nto bounding box coordinates and class probabilities, can\\nreduce time expense. We ﬁrstly reviews some pioneer CNN\\nmodels, and then focus on two signiﬁcant frameworks,\\nnamely You only look once (YOLO) [17] and Single Shot\\nMultiBox Detector (SSD) [71].\\n1) Pioneer Works: Previous to YOLO and SSD, many\\nresearchers have already tried to model object detection as\\na regression or classiﬁcation task.\\nSzegedy et al. formulated object detection task as a DNN-\\nbased regression [118], generating a binary mask for the\\ntest image and extracting detections with a simple bounding\\nbox inference. However, the model has difﬁculty in handling\\noverlapping objects, and bounding boxes generated by direct\\nupsampling is far from perfect.\\nPinheiro et al. proposed a CNN model with two branches:\\none generates class agnostic segmentation masks and the\\nother predicts the likelihood of a given patch centered on\\nan object [119]. Inference is efﬁcient since class scores and\\nsegmentation can be obtained in a single model with most of\\nthe CNN operations shared.\\nErhan et al. proposed regression based MultiBox to produce\\nscored class-agnostic region proposals [68], [120]. A uniﬁed\\nloss was introduced to bias both localization and conﬁdences\\nof multiple components to predict the coordinates of class-\\nagnostic bounding boxes. However, a large quantity of addi-\\ntional parameters are introduced to the ﬁnal layer.\\nYoo et al. adopted an iterative classiﬁcation approach to\\nhandle object detection and proposed an impressive end-to-\\nend CNN architecture named AttentionNet [69]. Starting from\\nthe top-left (TL) and bottom-right (BR) corner of an image,\\nAttentionNet points to a target object by generating quantized\\nweak directions and converges to an accurate object bound-\\nary box with an ensemble of iterative predictions. However,\\nthe model becomes quite inefﬁcient when handling multiple\\ncategories with a progressive two-step procedure.\\nNajibi et al. proposed a proposal-free iterative grid based\\nobject detector (G-CNN), which models object detection as'),\n",

Main idea of YOLO [17].\\nﬁnding a path from a ﬁxed grid to boxes tightly surrounding\\nthe objects [70]. Starting with a ﬁxed multi-scale bounding box\\ngrid, G-CNN trains a regressor to move and scale elements of\\nthe grid towards objects iteratively. However, G-CNN has a\\ndifﬁculty in dealing with small or highly overlapping objects.\\n2) YOLO: Redmon et al. [17] proposed a novel framework\\ncalled YOLO, which makes use of the whole topmost feature\\nmap to predict both conﬁdences for multiple categories and\\nbounding boxes. The basic idea of YOLO is exhibited in\\nFigure 9. YOLO divides the input image into an S×S grid and\\neach grid cell is responsible for predicting the object centered\\nin that grid cell. Each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes\\nand their corresponding conﬁdence scores. Formally, conﬁ-\\ndence scores are deﬁned as Pr(Object) ∗IOUtruth\\npred , which\\nindicates how likely there exist objects ( Pr(Object) ≥0) and\\nshows conﬁdences of its prediction ( IOUtruth\\npred ). At the same\\ntime, regardless of the number of boxes, C conditional class\\nprobabilities (Pr(Classi|Object)) should also be predicted in\\neach grid cell. It should be noticed that only the contribution\\nfrom the grid cell containing an object is calculated.\\nAt test time, class-speciﬁc conﬁdence scores for each box\\nare achieved by multiplying the individual box conﬁdence\\npredictions with the conditional class probabilities as follows.\\nPr(Object) ∗IOUtruth\\npred ∗Pr(Classi|Object)\\n= Pr(Classi) ∗IOUtruth\\npred\\n(5)\\nwhere the existing probability of class-speciﬁc objects in the\\nbox and the ﬁtness between the predicted box and the object\\nare both taken into consideration.\\nDuring training, the following loss function is optimized,\\nλcoord\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\nB∑\\nj=0\\n1 obj\\nij\\n[\\n(xi −ˆxi)2 + (yi −ˆyi)2]\\n+λcoord\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\nB∑\\nj=0\\n1 obj\\nij\\n[(√wi −\\n√\\nˆwi)2 + (\\n√\\nhi −\\n√\\nˆhi\\n)2]\\n+\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\nB∑\\nj=0\\n1 obj\\nij\\n(\\nCi −ˆCi\\n)2\\n+λnoobj\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\nB∑\\nj=0\\n1 noobj\\nij\\n(\\nCi −ˆCi\\n)2\\n+\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\n1 obj\\ni\\n∑\\nc∈classes\\n(pi(c) −ˆpi(c))2\\n(6)\\nIn a certain cell i, (xi,yi) denote the center of the box relative\\nto the bounds of the grid cell,(wi,hi) are the normalized width\\nand height relative to the image size, Ci represents conﬁdence\\nscores, 1 obj\\ni indicates the existence of objects and 1 obj\\nij denotes\\nthat the prediction is conducted by the jth bounding box\\npredictor. Note that only when an object is present in that grid\\ncell, the loss function penalizes classiﬁcation errors. Similarly,\\nwhen the predictor is ‘responsible’ for the ground truth box\\n(i.e. the highest IoU of any predictor in that grid cell is\\nachieved), bounding box coordinate errors are penalized.\\nThe YOLO consists of 24 conv layers and 2 FC layers,\\nof which some conv layers construct ensembles of inception\\nmodules with 1 ×1 reduction layers followed by 3 ×3 conv\\nlayers. The network can process images in real-time at 45\\nFPS and a simpliﬁed version Fast YOLO can reach 155 FPS\\nwith better results than other real-time detectors. Furthermore,\\nYOLO produces fewer false positives on background, which\\nmakes the cooperation with Fast R-CNN become possible. An\\nimproved version, YOLOv2, was later proposed in [72], which\\nadopts several impressive strategies, such as BN, anchor boxes,\\ndimension cluster and multi-scale training.\\n3) SSD: YOLO has a difﬁculty in dealing with small\\nobjects in groups, which is caused by strong spatial constraints\\nimposed on bounding box predictions [17]. Meanwhile, YOLO\\nstruggles to generalize to objects in new/unusual aspect ratios/\\nconﬁgurations and produces relatively coarse features due to\\nmultiple downsampling operations.\\nAiming at these problems, Liu et al. proposed a Single Shot\\nMultiBox Detector (SSD) [71], which was inspired by the\\nanchors adopted in MultiBox [68], RPN [18] and multi-scale\\nrepresentation [95]. Given a speciﬁc feature map, instead of\\nﬁxed grids adopted in YOLO, the SSD takes advantage of a set\\nof default anchor boxes with different aspect ratios and scales\\nto discretize the output space of bounding boxes. To handle\\nobjects with various sizes, the network fuses predictions from\\nmultiple feature maps with different resolutions .\\nThe architecture of SSD is demonstrated in Figure 10. Given\\nthe VGG16 backbone architecture, SSD adds several feature\\nlayers to the end of the network, which are responsible for\\npredicting the offsets to default boxes with different scales and\\naspect ratios and their associated conﬁdences. The network is\\ntrained with a weighted sum of localization loss (e.g. Smooth\\nL1) and conﬁdence loss (e.g. Softmax), which is similar to\\n(1). Final detection results are obtained by conducting NMS\\non multi-scale reﬁned bounding boxes.\\nIntegrating with hard negative mining, data augmentation\\nand a larger number of carefully chosen default anchors,\\nSSD signiﬁcantly outperforms the Faster R-CNN in terms of\\naccuracy on PASCAL VOC and COCO, while being three\\ntimes faster. The SSD300 (input image size is 300×300) runs\\nat 59 FPS, which is more accurate and efﬁcient than YOLO.\\nHowever, SSD is not skilled at dealing with small objects,\\nwhich can be relieved by adopting better feature extractor\\nbackbone (e.g. ResNet101), adding deconvolution layers with\\nskip connections to introduce additional large-scale context\\n[73] and designing better network structure (e.g. Stem Block\\nand Dense Block) [74].'),\n",

Experimental Evaluation\\nWe compare various object detection methods on three\\nbenchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC 2007 [25],\\nPASCAL VOC 2012 [121] and Microsoft COCO [94]. The\\nevaluated approaches include R-CNN [15], SPP-net [64], Fast\\nR-CNN [16], NOC [114], Bayes [85], MR-CNN &S-CNN\\n[105], Faster R-CNN [18], HyperNet [101], ION [95], MS-\\nGR [104], StuffNet [100], SSD300 [71], SSD512 [71], OHEM\\n[113], SDP+CRC [33], GCNN [70], SubCNN [60], GBD-Net\\n[109], PV ANET [116], YOLO [17], YOLOv2 [72], R-FCN\\n[65], FPN [66], Mask R-CNN [67], DSSD [73] and DSOD\\n[74]. If no speciﬁc instructions for the adopted framework\\nare provided, the utilized model is a VGG16 [46] pretrained\\non 1000-way ImageNet classiﬁcation task [39]. Due to the\\nlimitation of paper length, we only provide an overview, in-\\ncluding proposal, learning method, loss function, programming\\nlanguage and platform, of the prominent architectures in Table\\nI. Detailed experimental settings, which can be found in the\\noriginal papers, are missed. In addition to the comparisons of\\ndetection accuracy, another comparison is provided to evaluate\\ntheir test consumption on PASCAL VOC 2007.\\n1) PASCAL VOC 2007/2012: PASCAL VOC 2007 and\\n2012 datasets consist of 20 categories. The evaluation terms\\nare Average Precision (AP) in each single category and mean\\nAverage Precision (mAP) across all the 20 categories. Com-\\nparative results are exhibited in Table II and III, from which\\nthe following remarks can be obtained.\\n•If incorporated with a proper way, more powerful back-\\nbone CNN models can deﬁnitely improve object detection\\nperformance (the comparison among R-CNN with AlexNet,\\nR-CNN with VGG16 and SPP-net with ZF-Net [122]).\\n• With the introduction of SPP layer (SPP-net), end-to-\\nend multi-task architecture (FRCN) and RPN (Faster R-\\nCNN), object detection performance is improved gradually\\nand apparently.\\n•Due to large quantities of trainable parameters, in order to\\nobtain multi-level robust features, data augmentation is very\\nimportant for deep learning based models (Faster R-CNN\\nwith ‘07’ ,‘07+12’ and ‘07+12+coco’).\\n•Apart from basic models, there are still many other factors\\naffecting object detection performance, such as multi-scale\\nand multi-region feature extraction (e.g. MR-CNN), modi-\\nﬁed classiﬁcation networks (e.g. NOC), additional informa-\\ntion from other correlated tasks (e.g. StuffNet, HyperNet),\\nmulti-scale representation (e.g. ION) and mining of hard\\nnegative samples (e.g. OHEM).\\n•As YOLO is not skilled in producing object localizations\\nof high IoU, it obtains a very poor result on VOC 2012.\\nHowever, with the complementary information from Fast\\nR-CNN (YOLO+FRCN) and the aid of other strategies,\\nsuch as anchor boxes, BN and ﬁne grained features, the\\nlocalization errors are corrected (YOLOv2).\\n•By combining many recent tricks and modelling the whole\\nnetwork as a fully convolutional one, R-FCN achieves a\\nmore obvious improvement of detection performance over\\nother approaches.\\n2) Microsoft COCO: Microsoft COCO is composed of\\n300,000 fully segmented images, in which each image has\\nan average of 7 object instances from a total of 80 categories.\\nAs there are a lot of less iconic objects with a broad range\\nof scales and a stricter requirement on object localization,\\nthis dataset is more challenging than PASCAL 2012. Object\\ndetection performance is evaluated by AP computed under\\ndifferent degrees of IoUs and on different object sizes. The\\nresults are shown in Table IV.\\nBesides similar remarks to those of PASCAL VOC, some\\nother conclusions can be drawn as follows from Table IV.\\n• Multi-scale training and test are beneﬁcial in improv-\\ning object detection performance, which provide additional\\ninformation in different resolutions (R-FCN). FPN and\\nDSSD provide some better ways to build feature pyramids\\nto achieve multi-scale representation. The complementary\\ninformation from other related tasks is also helpful for\\naccurate object localization (Mask R-CNN with instance\\nsegmentation task).\\n• Overall, region proposal based methods, such as\\nFaster R-CNN and R-FCN, perform better than regres-\\nsion/classﬁcation based approaches, namely YOLO and\\nSSD, due to the fact that quite a lot of localization errors\\nare produced by regression/classﬁcation based approaches.\\n• Context modelling is helpful to locate small objects,\\nwhich provides additional information by consulting nearby\\nobjects and surroundings (GBD-Net and multi-path).\\n•Due to the existence of a large number of nonstandard\\nsmall objects, the results on this dataset are much worse\\nthan those of VOC 2007/2012. With the introduction of\\nother powerful frameworks (e.g. ResNeXt [123]) and useful\\nstrategies (e.g. multi-task learning [67], [124]), the perfor-\\nmance can be improved.\\n•The success of DSOD in training from scratch stresses the\\nimportance of network design to release the requirements\\nfor perfect pre-trained classiﬁers on relevant tasks and large\\nnumbers of annotated samples.\\n3) Timing Analysis: Timing analysis (Table V) is conducted\\non Intel i7-6700K CPU with a single core and NVIDIA Titan'),\n",

S ALIENT OBJECT DETECTION\\nVisual saliency detection, one of the most important and\\nchallenging tasks in computer vision, aims to highlight the\\nmost dominant object regions in an image. Numerous ap-\\nplications incorporate the visual saliency to improve their\\nperformance, such as image cropping [125] and segmentation\\n[126], image retrieval [57] and object detection [66].\\nBroadly, there are two branches of approaches in salient\\nobject detection, namely bottom-up (BU) [127] and top-down\\n(TD) [128]. Local feature contrast plays the central role in BU\\nsalient object detection, regardless of the semantic contents of\\nthe scene. To learn local feature contrast, various local and\\nglobal features are extracted from pixels, e.g. edges [129],\\nspatial information [130]. However, high-level and multi-scale\\nsemantic information cannot be explored with these low-level\\nfeatures. As a result, low contrast salient maps instead of\\nsalient objects are obtained. TD salient object detection is task-\\noriented and takes prior knowledge about object categories\\nto guide the generation of salient maps. Taking semantic\\nsegmentation as an example, a saliency map is generated in the\\nsegmentation to assign pixels to particular object categories via\\na TD approach [131]. In a word, TD saliency can be viewed\\nas a focus-of-attention mechanism, which prunes BU salient\\npoints that are unlikely to be parts of the object [132].\\nA. Deep learning in Salient Object Detection\\nDue to the signiﬁcance for providing high-level and multi-\\nscale feature representation and the successful applications\\nin many correlated computer vision tasks, such as semantic\\nsegmentation [131], edge detection [133] and generic object\\ndetection [16], it is feasible and necessary to extend CNN to\\nsalient object detection.\\nThe early work by Eleonora Vig et al. [28] follows a\\ncompletely automatic data-driven approach to perform a large-\\nscale search for optimal features, namely an ensemble of deep\\nnetworks with different layers and parameters. To address the\\nproblem of limited training data, Kummerer et al. proposed the\\nDeep Gaze [134] by transferring from the AlexNet to generate\\na high dimensional feature space and create a saliency map. A\\nsimilar architecture was proposed by Huang et al. to integrate\\nsaliency prediction into pre-trained object recognition DNNs\\n[135]. The transfer is accomplished by ﬁne-tuning DNNs’\\nweights with an objective function based on the saliency\\nevaluation metrics, such as Similarity, KL-Divergence and\\nNormalized Scanpath Saliency.\\nSome works combined local and global visual clues to\\nimprove salient object detection performance. Wang et al.\\ntrained two independent deep CNNs (DNN-L and DNN-G)\\nto capture local information and global contrast and predicted\\nsaliency maps by integrating both local estimation and global\\nsearch [136]. Cholakkal et al. proposed a weakly supervised\\nsaliency detection framework to combine visual saliency from\\nbottom-up and top-down saliency maps, and reﬁned the results\\nwith a multi-scale superpixel-averaging [137]. Zhao et al.\\nproposed a multi-context deep learning framework, which\\nutilizes a uniﬁed learning framework to model global and\\nlocal context jointly with the aid of superpixel segmentation\\n[138]. To predict saliency in videos, Bak et al. fused two\\nstatic saliency models, namely spatial stream net and tem-\\nporal stream net, into a two-stream framework with a novel\\nempirically grounded data augmentation technique [139].\\nComplementary information from semantic segmentation\\nand context modeling is beneﬁcial. To learn internal represen-\\ntations of saliency efﬁciently, He et al. proposed a novel su-\\nperpixelwise CNN approach called SuperCNN [140], in which\\nsalient object detection is formulated as a binary labeling\\nproblem. Based on a fully convolutional neural network, Li\\net al. proposed a multi-task deep saliency model, in which\\nintrinsic correlations between saliency detection and semantic\\nsegmentation are set up [141]. However, due to the conv layers\\nwith large receptive ﬁelds and pooling layers, blurry object\\nboundaries and coarse saliency maps are produced. Tang et\\nal. proposed a novel saliency detection framework (CRPSD)\\n[142], which combines region-level saliency estimation and\\npixel-level saliency prediction together with three closely\\nrelated CNNs. Li et al. proposed a deep contrast network\\nto combine segment-wise spatial pooling and pixel-level fully\\nconvolutional streams [143].\\nThe proper integration of multi-scale feature maps is also\\nof signiﬁcance for improving detection performance. Based\\non Fast R-CNN, Wang et al. proposed the RegionNet by\\nperforming salient object detection with end-to-end edge pre-\\nserving and multi-scale contextual modelling [144]. Liu et al.\\n[27] proposed a multi-resolution convolutional neural network\\n(Mr-CNN) to predict eye ﬁxations, which is achieved by\\nlearning both bottom-up visual saliency and top-down visual\\nfactors from raw image data simultaneously. Cornia et al.\\nproposed an architecture which combines features extracted at\\ndifferent levels of the CNN [145]. Li et al. proposed a multi-\\nscale deep CNN framework to extract three scales of deep\\ncontrast features [146], namely the mean-subtracted region,\\nthe bounding box of its immediate neighboring regions and\\nthe masked entire image, from each candidate region.\\nIt is efﬁcient and accurate to train a direct pixel-wise\\nCNN architecture to predict salient objects with the aids of\\nRNNs and deconvolution networks. Pan et al. formulated\\nsaliency prediction as a minimization optimization on the\\nEuclidean distance between the predicted saliency map and\\nthe ground truth and proposed two kinds of architectures\\n[147]: a shallow one trained from scratch and a deeper one\\nadapted from deconvoluted VGG network. As convolutional-\\ndeconvolution networks are not expert in recognizing objects\\nof multiple scales, Kuen et al. proposed a recurrent attentional\\nconvolutional-deconvolution network (RACDNN) with several\\nspatial transformer and recurrent network units to conquer\\nthis problem [148]. To fuse local, global and contextual\\ninformation of salient objects, Tang et al. developed a deeply-\\nsupervised recurrent convolutional neural network (DSRCNN)\\nto perform a full image-to-image saliency detection [149].'),\n",

Experimental Evaluation\\nFour representative datasets, including ECSSD [156], HKU-\\nIS [146], PASCALS [157], and SOD [158], are used to\\nevaluate several state-of-the-art methods. ECSSD consists of\\n1000 structurally complex but semantically meaningful natural\\nimages. HKU-IS is a large-scale dataset containing over 4000\\nchallenging images. Most of these images have more than\\none salient object and own low contrast. PASCALS is a\\nsubset chosen from the validation set of PASCAL VOC 2010\\nsegmentation dataset and is composed of 850 natural images.\\nThe SOD dataset possesses 300 images containing multiple\\nsalient objects. The training and validation sets for different\\ndatasets are kept the same as those in [152].\\nTwo standard metrics, namely F-measure and the mean\\nabsolute error (MAE), are utilized to evaluate the quality of a\\nsaliency map. Given precision and recall values pre-computed\\non the union of generated binary mask B and ground truth Z,\\nF-measure is deﬁned as below\\nFβ = (1 +β2)Presion ×Recall\\nβ2Presion + Recall (7)\\nwhere β2 is set to 0.3 in order to stress the importance of the\\nprecision value.\\nThe MAE score is computed with the following equation\\nMAE = 1\\nH×W\\nH∑\\ni=1\\nW∑\\nj=1\\n⏐⏐⏐ˆS(i,j) = ˆZ(i,j)\\n⏐⏐⏐ (8)\\nwhere ˆZ and ˆS represent the ground truth and the continuous\\nsaliency map, respectively. W and H are the width and\\nheight of the salient area, respectively. This score stresses\\nthe importance of successfully detected salient objects over\\ndetected non-salient pixels [159].\\nThe following approaches are evaluated: CHM [150], RC\\n[151], DRFI [152], MC [138], MDF [146], LEGS [136], DSR\\n[149], MTDNN [141], CRPSD [142], DCL [143], ELD [153],\\nNLDF [154] and DSSC [155]. Among these methods, CHM,\\nRC and DRFI are classical ones with the best performance\\n[159], while the other methods are all associated with CNN.\\nF-measure and MAE scores are shown in Table VI.\\nFrom Table VI, we can ﬁnd that CNN based methods\\nperform better than classic methods. MC and MDF combine\\nthe information from local and global context to reach a\\nmore accurate saliency. ELD refers to low-level handcrafted\\nfeatures for complementary information. LEGS adopts generic\\nregion proposals to provide initial salient regions, which may\\nbe insufﬁcient for salient detection. DSR and MT act in\\ndifferent ways by introducing recurrent network and semantic\\nsegmentation, which provide insights for future improvements.\\nCPRSD, DCL, NLDF and DSSC are all based on multi-scale\\nrepresentations and superpixel segmentation, which provide\\nrobust salient regions and smooth boundaries. DCL, NLDF\\nand DSSC perform the best on these four datasets. DSSC\\nearns the best performance by modelling scale-to-scale short-\\nconnections.\\nOverall, as CNN mainly provides salient information in\\nlocal regions, most of CNN based methods need to model\\nvisual saliency along region boundaries with the aid of su-\\nperpixel segmentation. Meanwhile, the extraction of multi-\\nscale deep CNN features is of signiﬁcance for measuring local\\nconspicuity. Finally, it’s necessary to strengthen local con-\\nnections between different CNN layers and as well to utilize\\ncomplementary information from local and global context.\\nV. F ACE DETECTION\\nFace detection is essential to many face applications and acts\\nas an important pre-processing procedure to face recognition\\n[160]–[162], face synthesis [163], [164] and facial expression\\nanalysis [165]. Different from generic object detection, this\\ntask is to recognize and locate face regions covering a very\\nlarge range of scales (30-300 pts vs. 10-1000 pts). At the same\\ntime, faces have their unique object structural conﬁgurations\\n(e.g. the distribution of different face parts) and characteristics\\n(e.g. skin color). All these differences lead to special attention\\nto this task. However, large visual variations of faces, such as\\nocclusions, pose variations and illumination changes, impose\\ngreat challenges for this task in real applications.\\nThe most famous face detector proposed by Viola and\\nJones [166] trains cascaded classiﬁers with Haar-Like features\\nand AdaBoost, achieving good performance with real-time\\nefﬁciency. However, this detector may degrade signiﬁcantly\\nin real-world applications due to larger visual variations of\\nhuman faces. Different from this cascade structure, Felzen-\\nszwalb et al. proposed a deformable part model (DPM) for face\\ndetection [24]. However, for these traditional face detection\\nmethods, high computational expenses and large quantities\\nof annotations are required to achieve a reasonable result.\\nBesides, their performance is greatly restricted by manually\\ndesigned features and shallow architecture.\\nA. Deep learning in Face Detection\\nRecently, some CNN based face detection approaches have\\nbeen proposed [167]–[169].As less accurate localization re-\\nsults from independent regressions of object coordinates, Yu\\net al. [167] proposed a novel IoU loss function for predicting\\nthe four bounds of box jointly. Farfade et al. [168] proposed a\\nDeep Dense Face Detector (DDFD) to conduct multi-view face\\ndetection, which is able to detect faces in a wide range of ori-\\nentations without requirement of pose/landmark annotations.\\nYang et al. proposed a novel deep learning based face detection\\nframework [169], which collects the responses from local fa-\\ncial parts (e.g. eyes, nose and mouths) to address face detection\\nunder severe occlusions and unconstrained pose variations.\\nYang et al. [170] proposed a scale-friendly detection network\\nnamed ScaleFace, which splits a large range of target scales\\ninto smaller sub-ranges. Different specialized sub-networks are\\nconstructed on these sub-scales and combined into a single\\none to conduct end-to-end optimization. Hao et al. designed an\\nefﬁcient CNN to predict the scale distribution histogram of the\\nfaces and took this histogram to guide the zoom-in and zoom-\\nout of the image [171]. Since the faces are approximately\\nin uniform scale after zoom, compared with other state-of-\\nthe-art baselines, better performance is achieved with less\\ncomputation cost. Besides, some generic detection frameworks'),\n",

P EDESTRIAN DETECTION\\nRecently, pedestrian detection has been intensively studied,\\nwhich has a close relationship to pedestrian tracking [189],\\n[190], person re-identiﬁcation [191], [192] and robot naviga-\\ntion [193], [194]. Prior to the recent progress in DCNN based\\nmethods [195], [196], some researchers combined boosted\\ndecision forests with hand-crafted features to obtain pedestrian\\ndetectors [197]–[199]. At the same time, to explicitly model\\nthe deformation and occlusion, part-based models [200] and\\nexplicit occlusion handling [201], [202] are of concern.\\nAs there are many pedestrian instances of small sizes\\nin typical scenarios of pedestrian detection (e.g. automatic\\ndriving and intelligent surveillance), the application of RoI\\npooling layer in generic object detection pipeline may result\\nin ‘plain’ features due to collapsing bins. In the meantime, the\\nmain source of false predictions in pedestrian detection is the\\nconfusion of hard background instances, which is in contrast\\nto the interference from multiple categories in generic object\\ndetection. As a result, different conﬁgurations and components\\nare required to accomplish accurate pedestrian detection.\\nA. Deep learning in Pedestrian Detection\\nAlthough DCNNs have obtained excellent performance on\\ngeneric object detection [16], [72], none of these approaches\\nhave achieved better results than the best hand-crafted feature\\nbased method [198] for a long time, even when part-based\\ninformation and occlusion handling are incorporated [202].\\nThereby, some researches have been conducted to analyze the\\nreasons. Zhang et al. attempted to adapt generic Faster R-CNN\\n[18] to pedestrian detection [203]. They modiﬁed the down-\\nstream classiﬁer by adding boosted forests to shared, high-\\nresolution conv feature maps and taking a RPN to handle small\\ninstances and hard negative examples. To deal with complex\\nocclusions existing in pedestrian images, inspired by DPM\\n[24], Tian et al. proposed a deep learning framework called\\nDeepParts [204], which makes decisions based an ensemble of\\nextensive part detectors. DeepParts has advantages in dealing\\nwith weakly labeled data, low IoU positive proposals and\\npartial occlusion.\\nOther researchers also tried to combine complementary in-\\nformation from multiple data sources. CompACT-Deep adopts\\na complexity-aware cascade to combine hand-crafted features\\nand ﬁne-tuned DCNNs [195]. Based on Faster R-CNN, Liu et\\nal. proposed multi-spectral deep neural networks for pedestrian\\ndetection to combine complementary information from color\\nand thermal images [205]. Tian et al. [206] proposed a task-\\nassistant CNN (TA-CNN) to jointly learn multiple tasks with\\nTABLE VII\\nDETAILED BREAKDOWN PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS OF\\nSTATE-OF-THE -ART MODELS ON CALTECH PEDESTRIAN DATASET .

Hu et al.

The ﬁrst two methods are based\\non hand-crafted features while the rest ones rely on deep CNN\\nfeatures. All results are exhibited in Table VII. From this table,\\nwe observe that different from other tasks, classic handcrafted\\nfeatures can still earn competitive results with boosted decision\\nforests [203], ACF [197] and HOG+LUV channels [S2]. As\\nan early attempt to adapt CNN to pedestrian detection, the\\nfeatures generated by SCF+AlexNet are not so discriminant\\nand produce relatively poor results. Based on multiple CNNs,\\nDeepParts and CompACT-Deep accomplish detection tasks via\\ndifferent strategies, namely local part integration and cascade\\nnetwork. The responses from different local part detectors\\nmake DeepParts robust to partial occlusions. However, due to\\ncomplexity, it is too time-consuming to achieve real-time de-\\ntection. The multi-scale representation of MS-CNN improves\\naccuracy of pedestrian locations. SA-FastRCNN extends Fast\\nR-CNN to automatically detecting pedestrians according to\\ntheir different scales, which has trouble when there are partial\\nocclusions. RPN+BF combines the detectors produced by\\nFaster R-CNN with boosting decision forest to accurately\\nlocate different pedestrians. F-DNN+SS, which is composed\\nof multiple parallel classiﬁers with soft rejections, performs\\nthe best followed by RPN+BF, SA-FastRCNN and MS-CNN.\\nIn short, CNN based methods can provide more accurate\\ncandidate boxes and multi-level semantic information for\\nidentifying and locating pedestrians. Meanwhile, handcrafted\\nfeatures are complementary and can be combined with CNN\\nto achieve better results. The improvements over existing CNN\\nmethods can be obtained by carefully designing the framework\\nand classiﬁers, extracting multi-scale and part based semantic\\ninformation and searching for complementary information\\nfrom other related tasks, such as segmentation.\\nVII. P ROMISING FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND TASKS\\nIn spite of rapid development and achieved promising\\nprogress of object detection, there are still many open issues\\nfor future work.\\nThe ﬁrst one is small object detection such as occurring\\nin COCO dataset and in face detection task. To improve\\nlocalization accuracy on small objects under partial occlusions,\\nit is necessary to modify network architectures from the\\nfollowing aspects.\\n• Multi-task joint optimization and multi-modal infor-\\nmation fusion. Due to the correlations between different\\ntasks within and outside object detection, multi-task joint\\noptimization has already been studied by many researchers\\n[16] [18]. However, apart from the tasks mentioned in\\nSubs. III-A8, it is desirable to think over the characteristics\\nof different sub-tasks of object detection (e.g. superpixel\\nsemantic segmentation in salient object detection) and ex-\\ntend multi-task optimization to other applications such as\\ninstance segmentation [66], multi-object tracking [202] and\\nmulti-person pose estimation [S4]. Besides, given a speciﬁc\\napplication, the information from different modalities, such\\nas text [212], thermal data [205] and images [65], can be\\nfused together to achieve a more discriminant network.\\n•Scale adaption. Objects usually exist in different scales,\\nwhich is more apparent in face detection and pedestrian\\ndetection. To increase the robustness to scale changes, it\\nis demanded to train scale-invariant, multi-scale or scale-\\nadaptive detectors. For scale-invariant detectors, more pow-\\nerful backbone architectures (e.g. ResNext [123]), negative\\nsample mining [113], reverse connection [213] and sub-\\ncategory modelling [60] are all beneﬁcial. For multi-scale\\ndetectors, both the FPN [66] which produces multi-scale\\nfeature maps and Generative Adversarial Network [214]\\nwhich narrows representation differences between small ob-\\njects and the large ones with a low-cost architecture provide\\ninsights into generating meaningful feature pyramid. For\\nscale-adaptive detectors, it is useful to combine knowledge\\ngraph [215], attentional mechanism [216], cascade network\\n[180] and scale distribution estimation [171] to detect ob-\\njects adaptively.\\n•Spatial correlations and contextual modelling. Spatial\\ndistribution plays an important role in object detection. So\\nregion proposal generation and grid regression are taken\\nto obtain probable object locations. However, the corre-\\nlations between multiple proposals and object categories\\nare ignored. Besides, the global structure information is\\nabandoned by the position-sensitive score maps in R-FCN.\\nTo solve these problems, we can refer to diverse subset\\nselection [217] and sequential reasoning tasks [218] for\\npossible solutions. It is also meaningful to mask salient parts\\nand couple them with the global structure in a joint-learning\\nmanner [219].\\nThe second one is to release the burden on manual labor and\\naccomplish real-time object detection, with the emergence of\\nlarge-scale image and video data. The following three aspects\\ncan be taken into account.\\n•Cascade network. In a cascade network, a cascade of\\ndetectors are built in different stages or layers [180], [220].\\nAnd easily distinguishable examples are rejected at shallow\\nlayers so that features and classiﬁers at latter stages can\\nhandle more difﬁcult samples with the aid of the decisions\\nfrom previous stages. However, current cascades are built in\\na greedy manner, where previous stages in cascade are ﬁxed\\nwhen training a new stage. So the optimizations of different\\nCNNs are isolated, which stresses the necessity of end-to-\\nend optimization for CNN cascade. At the same time, it\\nis also a matter of concern to build contextual associated\\ncascade networks with existing layers.\\n• Unsupervised and weakly supervised learning. It’s\\nvery time consuming to manually draw large quantities\\nof bounding boxes. To release this burden, semantic prior\\n[55], unsupervised object discovery [221], multiple instance\\nlearning [222] and deep neural network prediction [47] can\\nbe integrated to make best use of image-level supervision to\\nassign object category tags to corresponding object regions\\nand reﬁne object boundaries. Furthermore, weakly annota-\\ntions (e.g. center-click annotations [223]) are also helpful\\nfor achieving high-quality detectors with modest annotation\\nefforts, especially aided by the mobile platform.\\n• Network optimization. Given speciﬁc applications and\\nplatforms, it is signiﬁcant to make a balance among speed,'),\n",

However, despite that detection\\naccuracy is reduced, it is more meaningful to learn compact\\nmodels with fewer number of parameters [209]. And this\\nsituation can be relieved by introducing better pre-training\\nschemes [225], knowledge distillation [226] and hint learn-\\ning [227]. DSOD also provides a promising guideline to\\ntrain from scratch to bridge the gap between different image\\nsources and tasks [74].\\nThe third one is to extend typical methods for 2D object de-\\ntection to adapt 3D object detection and video object detection,\\nwith the requirements from autonomous driving, intelligent\\ntransportation and intelligent surveillance.\\n•3D object detection. With the applications of 3D sensors\\n(e.g. LIDAR and camera), additional depth information can\\nbe utilized to better understand the images in 2D and extend\\nthe image-level knowledge to the real world. However,\\nseldom of these 3D-aware techniques aim to place correct\\n3D bounding boxes around detected objects. To achieve\\nbetter bounding results, multi-view representation [181] and\\n3D proposal network [228] may provide some guidelines to\\nencode depth information with the aid of inertial sensors\\n(accelerometer and gyrometer) [229].\\n• Video object detection. Temporal information across\\ndifferent frames play an important role in understanding\\nthe behaviors of different objects. However, the accuracy\\nsuffers from degenerated object appearances (e.g., motion\\nblur and video defocus) in videos and the network is\\nusually not trained end-to-end. To this end, spatiotemporal\\ntubelets [230], optical ﬂow [199] and LSTM [107] should\\nbe considered to fundamentally model object associations\\nbetween consecutive frames.\\nVIII. C ONCLUSION\\nDue to its powerful learning ability and advantages in\\ndealing with occlusion, scale transformation and background\\nswitches, deep learning based object detection has been a\\nresearch hotspot in recent years. This paper provides a detailed\\nreview on deep learning based object detection frameworks\\nwhich handle different sub-problems, such as occlusion, clutter\\nand low resolution, with different degrees of modiﬁcations\\non R-CNN. The review starts on generic object detection\\npipelines which provide base architectures for other related\\ntasks. Then, three other common tasks, namely salient object\\ndetection, face detection and pedestrian detection, are also\\nbrieﬂy reviewed. Finally, we propose several promising future\\ndirections to gain a thorough understanding of the object\\ndetection landscape. This review is also meaningful for the\\ndevelopments in neural networks and related learning systems,\\nwhich provides valuable insights and guidelines for future\\nprogress.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThis research was supported by the National Natural Sci-\\nence Foundation of China (No.61672203 & 61375047 &\\n91746209), the National Key Research and Development Pro-\\ngram of China (2016YFB1000901), and Anhui Natural Sci-\\nence Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar (No.170808J08).\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] P.

Deep learning in Pedestrian Detection\\nAlthough DCNNs have obtained excellent performance on\\ngeneric object detection [16], [72], none of these approaches\\nhave achieved better results than the best hand-crafted feature\\nbased method [198] for a long time, even when part-based\\ninformation and occlusion handling are incorporated [202].\\nThereby, some researches have been conducted to analyze the\\nreasons. Zhang et al. attempted to adapt generic Faster R-CNN\\n[18] to pedestrian detection [203]. They modiﬁed the down-\\nstream classiﬁer by adding boosted forests to shared, high-\\nresolution conv feature maps and taking a RPN to handle small',\n",
